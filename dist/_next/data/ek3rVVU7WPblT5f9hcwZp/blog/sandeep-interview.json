{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\nSandeep Srinivasan is a veteran of the machine learning industry. While most have gravitated towards it since the hype of the late 2000s, Srinivasan claims he has been “interested in machine learning since the 1990s,” almost noachian in this quickly evolving field. Today, I sat down with Srinivasan in order to glean what insights he has after pioneering this industry for 30 years. \n\nI am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn. \n\nFinding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.\n\nDespite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients. \n\nThe main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge. \n\t\nDoctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning. I suggest to the reader to conduct a similar informational interview, in the hopes that one could learn about an intriguing field from a personality. \n\n\n \n","date":"Feb 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," interview"," coding"],"title":"Interview with Machine Learning Expert","slug":"sandeep-interview","description":"After his 30 years in the field, machine learning engineer Sandeep Srinivasan offers advice on how to tackle this complex career.","image":"/images/sandeep.jpg"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\n\n\n# What is an RSS Feed\n\nRSS is a standard by which you may subscribe to the content of other websites, and recieve updates about the news on other websites in a \nstandardized way so that many programs can read and understand the infromation. RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.

If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\nThe text editor VIM is possibly one of my favourite tools for developing and coding.

Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again. There is something immensely satisfying about executing the proper algorithm in VIM which I strive for every time I code. \n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["vim"],"title":"Why I love VIM","slug":"why-i-love-vim","description":"Vim is arguable the best text editor","image":"/images/vim.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
