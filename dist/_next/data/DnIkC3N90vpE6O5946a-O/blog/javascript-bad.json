{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad. Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\nI have written this blog post to commemorate how my site has started today.

If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
