RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.

Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},{"content":"\n\nSince haskell is a list-based language, there are many ways to work with lists.
