He says this due to his\nview that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.\nMy view is that **a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model\nof computation**. I will explain what I mean.\n\n## Models of Computation\nAccording to Wikipedia, a [Model of Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) is\n\"a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input\".\nThere are a list of models of computation on the page, which include\n- Post machines\n- Pushdown automata\n- Register machines\n- Random-access machines\n- Turing machines\n- Decision tree model\n- Abstract rewriting systems\n- Combinatory logic\n- General recursive functions\n- Lambda calculus\n- Actor model\n- Cellular automaton\n- Interaction nets\n- Kahn process networks\n- Logic gates and digital circuits\n- Petri nets\n- Synchronous Data Flow\n\nAs you can see, there are many models of computation.\n## Minimal Addition\nWhat do I mean by \"minimal additon\". Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means\nsome abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold\nstandard for this is [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell), with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such\nas Haskell's monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.\n\n## Examples of Well-Loved Languages\n\nI will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good\nmodels of computation.\n\n\n| Model of Computation| Language|\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Untyped Lambda Calculus | Lisp|\n| Typed Lambda Calculus | Haskell|\n| Predicate Logic | Prolog |\n| Rewriting System | Wolfram |\n| Actor Model | Smalltalk |\n| Interaction Nets | [Kind2](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2) |\n| Combinatory Logic | APL | \n\nHopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.\nAnd what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.\n\nLet us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the [minimal wrapper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782) on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features\nbeyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference\nbetween Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)\nbut Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly\nborrows concepts from other languages.\n\n## Turing Completeness\nDue to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.\nSo, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model\nthat is the best for our needs.\n\n## Good Models of Computation\nGiven all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?\nI think it comes down to 2 critera:\n- being simple\n- having nice properties\n\nFor the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the [SK Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus) is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model\nof computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of\na model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain. \n\nFor the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and\nfast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is [Interaction Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties) because they have these properties\n\n- locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)\n- linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)\n- strong confluence \n\nThese properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing\nan implementation.\n\n\n## Advice to Aspiring Language Designers\nIf you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to\nchoose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would\nnot design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected\nby Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because\nProlog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can\nbe executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right\nnow I think the field of Linear Logic doesn't have its own industry-strength programming\nlanguage. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.\n\n\n## Summary\nIn short, a programming language is nothing but an implentation of a model of computation.","date":"Oct 10, 2022","tags":["programming"," math"," computation"," lisp"],"title":"How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage","slug":"create-language","description":"I have come up with a method to design well-loved languages","image":"/images/lisp.png"},{"content":"\nI have written this blog post to commemorate how my site has started today.
