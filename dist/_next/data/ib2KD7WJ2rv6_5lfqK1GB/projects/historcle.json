{"pageProps":{"project":{"content":"\nI was inspired by the word-guessing game [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)\nto make my own spin on this fun idea. I am very passionate about [history](https://atticuskuhn.github.io/blog/historical-music), so I decided to make a game where you guess a historical figure.\n\nFor each guess, you get to know the distance away they were born, how many years apart they were born\nand some commonalities. For example, if the secret person was Napoleon and you guessed, historicle\nwould tell you they were born 9000 km apart, they were born 235 years apart, and both were commissioned\nmilitary officers.\n\nI think my game is really fun, so if you have any feedback, please [contact me](/contact)","date":"May 1, 2022","tags":["history"," guessing"," guessing game"," wordle"],"title":"Historcle","slug":"historcle","description":"Can you guess this historical figure?","image":"/images/peel.jpg","previewUrl":"https://atticuskuhn.github.io/historcle/","sourceCodeUrl":"https://github.com/AtticusKuhn/historcle"}},"__N_SSG":true}
