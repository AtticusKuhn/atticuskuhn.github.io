<p>I am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn.</p>
<p>Finding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.</p>
<p>Despite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients.</p>
<p>The main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Doctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.</p>
<p>Overall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning. I suggest to the reader to conduct a similar informational interview, in the hopes that one could learn about an intriguing field from a personality.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/historical-music"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="What Can We Learn from Historical Music?" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Theobald_I.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">What Can We Learn from Historical Music?</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">We can glean a lot from music.</div></div></a><a href="/blog/fav-lang"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="My favourite Programming languages" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/php.png"/><div class="font-bold">My favourite Programming languages</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job</div></div></a><a href="/blog/machine-learning-overrated"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Machine Learning is overrated" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Machine Learning is overrated</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I don&#x27;t understand the hype around machine learning</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>Ⓒ all rights reserved Atticus Kuhn <!-- -->2022</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\nSandeep Srinivasan is a veteran of the machine learning industry.

I have been interested in history for a long time, and if you are also interested\nin history, then I think that music is uniquely positioned to gain an understanding of the past.\nHumans have been creating music for [at least 3500 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tfBLvlN98),\nand probably longer, so there seems to be something intrisic to humans about creating music.\nFurthermore, since most songs are short (on the order of 5 minutes), we must distill our soul\nand essence into a simple and memorable phrase in order to be musical. This desire creates brevity,\nwhich can easily help us gain the gist of a historical society. This need is amplified\nby folk music, which is designed to be easily sung by large groups of people, so is often\nmelodically and lyrically simple (simple does not necessarily mean bad). These are the\nhistorical societies I will analyze through the lens of music\n\n\n# Soviet Union / Russia\nThe first song we will look at is [Swallowing Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAoibAgAvM).\nBelow I have posted the lyrics:\n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|Да один, я остался один |yes, I was alone|\n|а все друзья мои полегли,|and all my friends perished,|\n|Вся надежда – один магазин|all hope is on one magazine|\n|просто так не возьмёте, скоты!| But you won't take me that easy, brutes!|\n\nWe can see that the Russians fight till the end with resourcefullness (\"But you won't take me that easy\"). I think this is in keeping with Russian character. Looking at [Russian History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia), it is certainly brutal. This song portrays Russian\nstoicism and bravery in the face of hardships, but another song shows the other face of\nthe coin. [Don't Tell Mom I'm In Chechnya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHCzaiJEoEY)\nis a more depressing song about a soldier lamenting and cursing the horrors of the\nChechnyan War. \n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|С другом Саней что он вернется держу пари|I made a bet with my friend Sanya, that he will return|\n|Ты только маме что я в Чечне не говори.|Just don't tell mom that I'm in Chechnya.|\n\nThe dark truth is that if the singer made a bet against Sanya that he will come back, that\nimplies that Sanya bet he would die. In the hard history of Russia, I imagine that a\nbit of morbid humour would be necessary to survive and make sense of it. \n\n\n# Germany\nThe next culture we will look at the songs of is Germany. One especially moving song is\n[Ich Hatt' Einen Kameraden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1Z1y2PSNw).\n\n| German | English|\n| ------ | -------|\n|Er liegt vor meinen Füßen|Now he lies here at my feet|\n|Als wär's ein Stück von mir|As if he were part of me|\n|Will mir die Hand noch reichen,|Yet he reached out his hand to me,|\n|Kann dir die Hand nicht geben|I cannot take your hand, right now|\n|Bleib du im ew'gen Leben|May you rest there, in eternal life|\n \nPrussia has sometimes been described as [not a country with an army, but an army with a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army#:~:text=The%20social%20classes%20were%20all,an%20army%20with%20a%20country%22.). This lead to many great military victories for Prussia, but\nalso immense loss for the soldiers on the battlefield. The line that particularly stands\nout is \"As if he were part of me\", because it depicts the tight bond that forms between\nsoldiers on the battlfield. The singer and his comrade are so close that theey feel\nphysically attached.\n\nOn a more uplifiting note, the next song we will look at is [Palästinalied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UBQArOa5c), a song based on a poem from the 13th century.\n|German|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Nû lebe ich mir alrêrst werde,| Now I live only worthy|\n|sît mîn sündic ouge sihet| Since my sinful eye sees|\n|daz hêre lant und ouch die erde,| The pure land and also the earth|\n|der man vil der êren gihet.| which is worshipped so much|\n\nYou can almost hear the wonder coming from this song. I like to imagine a knight who has\nheard so much about Jerusalem finally arriving and praising what he sees. Even though, this\nsong still remains a tone solumn and humble (\"sinful eye sees\"). It's almost like\nthe author is humbled by being in such a special place. \n \n \n# France\nNow onto a nation bording Germany, which is France. I have recently taken a liking\nto the song [Vive Henri IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MFBD15ehjA)\n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Au diable guerres,|To hell with wars,\n|Rancunes et partis !|Grudges and partisanship!|\n|Comme nos pères|Like our fathers|\n|Chantons en vrais amis,|Let us sing as true friends,\n|Au choc des verres,|Clink the glasses,|\n|Les roses et les lys.|The roses and the lilies.|\n\nAside from having a really spritely melody, the lyrics also have a fun and playful nature.\nIt has a message of celebration, not only of the honourable monarch [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), but also of the festivites. I reccomend singing this song\nat your next party.\n\nWe will next study [Seigneurs, Sachiez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s), which\nwas amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing\nsuch a good song? \n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça| All the bad people will stay behind|\n|qui n'aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.| those who don't love God, honor, or pray to Him|\n|Et chascuns dit: \"Ma feme, que fera?| And some say \"what will my wife do?|\n|Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!\"| I will not leave without my friends\"|\n|Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,|These men have fallen into foolish concerns|\n|qu'il n'est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,| For man has no friends except|\n|qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.| He who was put on the true cross for our sake|\n\nI imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.\nAs a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far\naway and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his\nmessage. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading (\"what will my \nwife do?\"), and then explains why these concerns are not valid. \n\n# Britain\nBritain is a country close to my heart, and it also has some very good songs.\nThe first song is [My England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU123EhCjBA)\n\n### My England\nBorn and raised in a laying land  \nThe guardian of the islands  \nWhere the rolling hills and the mountain streams  \nmeet the sweet sweet peace of the highlands  \nOh how I love my motherland, this blessed land of freedom  \nWhere every heart that shares her peace, feels the glory of her Eden  \nAnd she lifts up my soul like a bright sunny day  \nand she stays in my life like a song  \n\nThese expressive lyrics capture the beauty of the English countryside. I can almost imagine \\\nthe green pastures of Yorkshire when I listen to this song.\n\nAnd I would be remissed not to mention the most famous British historical song: [The British\nGrenadiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrxHO-B2TY)\n\n### The British Grenadiers\nSome talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules  \nOf Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.  \nBut of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare.  \nWith a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.  \n\nI do like the sophisticated swagger and bravado of this song. It's has the confident tone\nof dismissing these heros of antiquity. From the first bars, we can tell from this self-confidence\nthat this is going to be a fun and uplifting song. \n\n# Yugoslavia\nThere is a very good video [\"My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg) that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason\nwhy Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,\nwhere 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages\nare all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.\nThey accomplished this through music. First, we will look at [My Dad is a War Criminal!\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8).\n\n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Moj je tata zločinac iz rata|My dad is a war criminal \n|Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite|You can try condemning him|\n|Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda |But no one has the balls to arrest him |\n\nApparantly this song is satire of the UN, who called Serbia war criminals. Honestly,\nit's a really funny song because it contains an unsual topic. I don't know any other\nsongs where the singer just openly admits war crimes. \nThe next song we will look at is [Crni Bombarderi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333OVHhpK5c).\nIt's by Roki Vulovic, who has many other great songs you should also check out. \n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Da li je to istina ili se samo šališ|Is it the truth or are you just joking ?|\n|Na Balkanu hoćeš vatru da zapališ|You want to start a fire on the balkans| \n|Prijatelju stari iz prošloga rata|Old friend from the previous war|\n|Stavićeš i sebi omcu oko vrata|You'll put the rope around your own neck|\n|Sa Srbima ne smije inat da se tera|Don't pick a fight with the defiant serbs|\n|Izgubićeš jato crnih bombardera|You'll lose your swarm of black bombers|\n\nThis song refers to the [1999 F-117A shootdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown)\nincident. The US had the most advanced stealth technology in the world, and said\ntheir bomber was invisible. The Serbs had obselete Soviet missile technology,\nyet still managed to shoot down the plane.  They said [\"Sorry we didn't know it was invisible\"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_poster_%22Sorry_we_didn%27t_know_it_was_invisible%22.jpg).\nI think that's a pretty amazing story, and the story is reflected in the lyrics of the song.\n\n# Conclusion\nI am trying to expand my collection of historical music. If you have any historical\nsongs that you want me to add to this blog or that you want me to know about,\nplease [contact me](/contact).\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n","date":"April 11, 2022","tags":["History"," Music"],"title":"What Can We Learn from Historical Music?","slug":"historical-music","description":"We can glean a lot from music.","image":"/images/Theobald_I.jpg"},{"content":"\n\nWith so many different programming languages and technologies available today, it can sometimes be confusing on which to choose for a new project. If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\nIn recent years, we've seen a lot of hype around machine learning. From [alpha go](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), which beat world-champion go\nplayers, to [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the constant news buzz\nwould make one think we are around the corner from [AI Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But I claim today that most of AI is just hype, with no\nreal substance behind it. Of course time will tell the true use of AI. In fact, most\ntimes teams eagerly throw a [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) at\na problem, they are really looking for a symbolic manipulation tool like [prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\n\n# Black Boxes\n\nThe first drawback of machine learning is they are incomprehensible. If a machine learning model\nmakes a mistake, how will you figure out what went wrong? There is no real way of knowing. Sure,\nyou can look at the internal state of the model, but what does that really tell you?\nModels today are getting so large that it is impossible to hold a single one in your\nbrain. GPT-3 has [175 billion parameters](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai/#:~:text=The%20largest%20version%20GPT%2D3,and%203.2%20M%20batch%20size.\u0026text=Shown%20in%20the%20figure%20above,that%20it%20is%20quite%20larger.)\nparameters. What if it makes a mistake? Will some engineer have to go through all\n175 billion parameters just to find it? I think the true solution is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) software\nthat simply states rules or definitions. That code is easier to debug and understand for\nnew users. In essence, we can only look at machine learning as a black box.\n\n# Changing Requirements\n\nOften in software engineering, projects are subject to [changing requirements](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/help-the-requirements-keep-changing-and-i-cant-nail-them-down-part-2/).\nWhat happens when this is done to a machine learning model? In short, I don't\nsee how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on\na slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model\nevery time you want to make a change. Google even spoke about this issue in their\npaper [Machine Learning:\nThe High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf). In our ever-changing world, you must truly\nconsider if you want to use a technology that requires so much effort even to change\nits purpose slightly.\n\n# Declarative Programming: is it Nirvana?\n\nI am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language) or from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\nIn such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and\nthe language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand\nbecause it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand\nthe behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never\nheard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other\nprogramming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage. It will rethink the way\nthat you understand the purpose of computers, [so try it out](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).","date":"January 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," ml"," AI"],"title":"Machine Learning is overrated","slug":"machine-learning-overrated","description":"I don't understand the hype around machine learning","image":"/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"sandeep-interview"},"buildId":"6832vvZ8B5LJTFZaxZRTx","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
