<p>As I have created a personal site (you&#x27;re looking at it right now), I feel somewhat
qualified to give advice to others on the best way of creating a personal site. Of course,
if you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.</p>
<p>Specifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather
I will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Fast and Functional</h1>
<p>This might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators
such as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn&#x27;t need it.
When I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and
trackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give
your users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this
same advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack
turning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their
personal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/
whatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations</h1>
<p>I see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge
to use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is
slow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,
then I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology
to get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations
as an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place
where it doesn&#x27;t interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small
and less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in
rage at this mound of useless animations.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Create Lots of Content</h1>
<p>This advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of
content has a two-fold benefit</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">
<p>As you write more, you will become better at writing</p>
</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">
<p>By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on
your site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites.
Of course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),
yet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing
long articles</p>

If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\n\n# Boolean Considered Harmful\n\nI make the claim that using the boolean type (called \"Boolean\")\nis always a bad design decesion. This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad. Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"create-personal-site"},"buildId":"2CjezTMq4S5gBXYBE1L2E","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
