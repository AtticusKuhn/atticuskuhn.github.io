<p>As I have created a personal site (you&#x27;re looking at it right now), I feel somewhat
qualified to give advice to others on the best way of creating a personal site. Of course,
if you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.</p>
<p>Specifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather
I will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Fast and Functional</h1>
<p>This might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators
such as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn&#x27;t need it.
When I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and
trackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give
your users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this
same advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack
turning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their
personal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/
whatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations</h1>
<p>I see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge
to use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is
slow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,
then I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology
to get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations
as an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place
where it doesn&#x27;t interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small
and less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in
rage at this mound of useless animations.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Create Lots of Content</h1>
<p>This advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of
content has a two-fold benefit</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">
<p>As you write more, you will become better at writing</p>
</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">
<p>By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on
your site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites.
Of course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),
yet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing
long articles</p>

If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\nSince haskell is a list-based language, there are many ways to work with lists.
