<p>Like Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system
will eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability. Decidability
basically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. <a href="https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Adding Numbers</a> is decidable but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">finding the shortest path</a> is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in
all systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more
rules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?
I will start with a few examples</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Typing Systems for Programming Languages</h1>
<p>I first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically
an algorithm that says <code>5</code> is an integer or <code>[1,2,3]</code> is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Algorithm W</a>. A type system is very useful,
but people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they
try to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">C</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">printf</a>, you might realise that the type of the second
argument depends on the type of the first argument.</p>

<p>If you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered
dependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently
typed program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">halting problem</a>). One you say you want this, you have stepped out
of the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler
using a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Idris</a>. A good documentation of this problem is on the website <a href="https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">typing is hard</a>.</p>
<p>In my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don&#x27;t want
to have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Hindley-Milner</a> which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Presbuger Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Another beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Presburger Arithmetic</a>. Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic
where every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say
<code>x+y &gt; 10</code> and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?
There is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.
So statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And
Once we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Undecidability is Interesting</h1>
<p>Unlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do <strong>not</strong>
want decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no
interesting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between
expressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose
interesting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,
truth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is
true, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses
all its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn&#x27;t so bad.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Walking off the Cliff</h1>
<p>What can you take away from this? Well let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re designing a programming tool like
a configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,
unwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,
where now they are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">turing complete</a> (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to
keep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that
might cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4"><a href="/blog/boolHarmful"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Boolean Considered Harmful" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/babBools.png"/><div class="font-bold">Boolean Considered Harmful</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Most uses of Boolean are wrong</div></div></a><a href="/blog/javascript-bad"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Javascript Being Bad is why it&#x27;s Good" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/techs/javascript.png"/><div class="font-bold">Javascript Being Bad is why it&#x27;s Good</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons</div></div></a><a href="/blog/ross"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="A Review of the Ross Program" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/ross-logo.svg"/><div class="font-bold">A Review of the Ross Program</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I just attended the Ross Program</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span><a href="/rss.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">RSS feed</a> |<a href="/atom.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">atom feed</a> |<a href="/rss.json" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">JSON feed</a> | MIT License <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\n# What is Undecidability\n\nLike Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system\nwill eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability.

This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad.

These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that\nthe Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.\n\n## The Math\n\nOn the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that \nthe Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in\nnumber theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think\nthat proving that if a is divisible by b, then b \u003c a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,\nwe go **FULL RIGOR**, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal\ninference or hand waving (the student's response: \"full rigor leads to rigor mortis\"). All the problem\nsets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers. \n\n## The Counsellors\nAll the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say \"I have a math problem\" and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are\ngraded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person \"family\" with a consellor creates a sense\nof camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.\n\n\n## Lectures\nSpecial lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/). These are\nvery exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms\nto computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson's Pigeonhole lecture series in\nthe first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened\nmy conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar's talk on the [hyper-reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)\n\n## The Community\nThe community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it\nis quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math. \nWe all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel\nthat the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that **it prepares you for how life will be in\nuniversity**. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people\nin a similar major to discuss your shared passion. \n\n## The Food\nI'd rather not dwell on this subject for too long.\n\n\n## Tips\nIf you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.\n- learn how to use a washing machine before you go\n- bring some emergency food with you\n- **pro tip:** bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring \na sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.\n- In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over\nwho say up very late and you don't want to be kept awake\n- The Ross website may claim that you shouldn't bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but \nyou will probably be fine if you bring these things.\n\n\n## Should you go to Ross?\nIf you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply \nto the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math\nbefore, but I really liked the experience.
