<p>Like Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system
will eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability. Decidability
basically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. <a href="https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Adding Numbers</a> is decidable but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">finding the shortest path</a> is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in
all systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more
rules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?
I will start with a few examples</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Typing Systems for Programming Languages</h1>
<p>I first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically
an algorithm that says <code>5</code> is an integer or <code>[1,2,3]</code> is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Algorithm W</a>. A type system is very useful,
but people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they
try to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">C</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">printf</a>, you might realise that the type of the second
argument depends on the type of the first argument.</p>

<p>If you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered
dependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently
typed program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">halting problem</a>). One you say you want this, you have stepped out
of the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler
using a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Idris</a>. A good documentation of this problem is on the website <a href="https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">typing is hard</a>.</p>
<p>In my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don&#x27;t want
to have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Hindley-Milner</a> which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Presbuger Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Another beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Presburger Arithmetic</a>. Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic
where every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say
<code>x+y &gt; 10</code> and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?
There is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.
So statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And
Once we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Undecidability is Interesting</h1>
<p>Unlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do <strong>not</strong>
want decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no
interesting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between
expressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose
interesting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,
truth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is
true, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses
all its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn&#x27;t so bad.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Walking off the Cliff</h1>
<p>What can you take away from this? Well let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re designing a programming tool like
a configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,
unwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,
where now they are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">turing complete</a> (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to
keep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that
might cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/create-language"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/lisp.png"/><div class="font-bold">How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I have come up with a method to design well-loved languages</div></div></a><a href="/blog/ross"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="A Review of the Ross Program" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/ross-logo.svg"/><div class="font-bold">A Review of the Ross Program</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I just attended the Ross Program</div></div></a><a href="/blog/historical-music"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="What Can We Learn from Historical Music?" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Theobald_I.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">What Can We Learn from Historical Music?</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">We can glean a lot from music.</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>Ⓒ all rights reserved <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\n# What is Undecidability\n\nLike Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system\nwill eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability.

He says this due to his\nview that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.\nMy view is that **a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model\nof computation**. I will explain what I mean.\n\n## Models of Computation\nAccording to Wikipedia, a [Model of Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) is\n\"a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input\".\nThere are a list of models of computation on the page, which include\n- Post machines\n- Pushdown automata\n- Register machines\n- Random-access machines\n- Turing machines\n- Decision tree model\n- Abstract rewriting systems\n- Combinatory logic\n- General recursive functions\n- Lambda calculus\n- Actor model\n- Cellular automaton\n- Interaction nets\n- Kahn process networks\n- Logic gates and digital circuits\n- Petri nets\n- Synchronous Data Flow\n\nAs you can see, there are many models of computation.\n## Minimal Addition\nWhat do I mean by \"minimal additon\". Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means\nsome abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold\nstandard for this is [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell), with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such\nas Haskell's monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.\n\n## Examples of Well-Loved Languages\n\nI will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good\nmodels of computation.\n\n\n| Model of Computation| Language|\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Untyped Lambda Calculus | Lisp|\n| Typed Lambda Calculus | Haskell|\n| Predicate Logic | Prolog |\n| Rewriting System | Wolfram |\n| Actor Model | Smalltalk |\n| Interaction Nets | [Kind2](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2) |\n| Combinatory Logic | APL | \n\nHopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.\nAnd what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.\n\nLet us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the [minimal wrapper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782) on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features\nbeyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference\nbetween Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)\nbut Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly\nborrows concepts from other languages.\n\n## Turing Completeness\nDue to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.\nSo, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model\nthat is the best for our needs.\n\n## Good Models of Computation\nGiven all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?\nI think it comes down to 2 critera:\n- being simple\n- having nice properties\n\nFor the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the [SK Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus) is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model\nof computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of\na model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain. \n\nFor the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and\nfast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is [Interaction Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties) because they have these properties\n\n- locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)\n- linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)\n- strong confluence \n\nThese properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing\nan implementation.\n\n\n## Advice to Aspiring Language Designers\nIf you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to\nchoose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would\nnot design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected\nby Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because\nProlog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can\nbe executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right\nnow I think the field of Linear Logic doesn't have its own industry-strength programming\nlanguage. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.\n\n\n## Summary\nIn short, a programming language is nothing but an implentation of a model of computation.","date":"Oct 10, 2022","tags":["programming"," math"," computation"," lisp"],"title":"How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage","slug":"create-language","description":"I have come up with a method to design well-loved languages","image":"/images/lisp.png"},{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that\nthe Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.\n\n## The Math\n\nOn the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that \nthe Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in\nnumber theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think\nthat proving that if a is divisible by b, then b \u003c a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,\nwe go **FULL RIGOR**, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal\ninference or hand waving (the student's response: \"full rigor leads to rigor mortis\"). All the problem\nsets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers. \n\n## The Counsellors\nAll the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say \"I have a math problem\" and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are\ngraded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person \"family\" with a consellor creates a sense\nof camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.\n\n\n## Lectures\nSpecial lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/). These are\nvery exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms\nto computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson's Pigeonhole lecture series in\nthe first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened\nmy conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar's talk on the [hyper-reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)\n\n## The Community\nThe community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it\nis quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math. \nWe all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel\nthat the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that **it prepares you for how life will be in\nuniversity**. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people\nin a similar major to discuss your shared passion. \n\n## The Food\nI'd rather not dwell on this subject for too long.\n\n\n## Tips\nIf you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.\n- learn how to use a washing machine before you go\n- bring some emergency food with you\n- **pro tip:** bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring \na sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.\n- In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over\nwho say up very late and you don't want to be kept awake\n- The Ross website may claim that you shouldn't bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but \nyou will probably be fine if you bring these things.\n\n\n## Should you go to Ross?\nIf you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply \nto the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math\nbefore, but I really liked the experience.

I have been interested in history for a long time, and if you are also interested\nin history, then I think that music is uniquely positioned to gain an understanding of the past.\nHumans have been creating music for [at least 3500 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tfBLvlN98),\nand probably longer, so there seems to be something intrisic to humans about creating music.\nFurthermore, since most songs are short (on the order of 5 minutes), we must distill our soul\nand essence into a simple and memorable phrase in order to be musical. This desire creates brevity,\nwhich can easily help us gain the gist of a historical society. This need is amplified\nby folk music, which is designed to be easily sung by large groups of people, so is often\nmelodically and lyrically simple (simple does not necessarily mean bad). These are the\nhistorical societies I will analyze through the lens of music\n\n\n# Soviet Union / Russia\nThe first song we will look at is [Swallowing Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAoibAgAvM).\nBelow I have posted the lyrics:\n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|Да один, я остался один |yes, I was alone|\n|а все друзья мои полегли,|and all my friends perished,|\n|Вся надежда – один магазин|all hope is on one magazine|\n|просто так не возьмёте, скоты!| But you won't take me that easy, brutes!|\n\nWe can see that the Russians fight till the end with resourcefullness (\"But you won't take me that easy\"). I think this is in keeping with Russian character. Looking at [Russian History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia), it is certainly brutal. This song portrays Russian\nstoicism and bravery in the face of hardships, but another song shows the other face of\nthe coin. [Don't Tell Mom I'm In Chechnya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHCzaiJEoEY)\nis a more depressing song about a soldier lamenting and cursing the horrors of the\nChechnyan War. \n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|С другом Саней что он вернется держу пари|I made a bet with my friend Sanya, that he will return|\n|Ты только маме что я в Чечне не говори.|Just don't tell mom that I'm in Chechnya.|\n\nThe dark truth is that if the singer made a bet against Sanya that he will come back, that\nimplies that Sanya bet he would die. In the hard history of Russia, I imagine that a\nbit of morbid humour would be necessary to survive and make sense of it. \n\n\n# Germany\nThe next culture we will look at the songs of is Germany. One especially moving song is\n[Ich Hatt' Einen Kameraden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1Z1y2PSNw).\n\n| German | English|\n| ------ | -------|\n|Er liegt vor meinen Füßen|Now he lies here at my feet|\n|Als wär's ein Stück von mir|As if he were part of me|\n|Will mir die Hand noch reichen,|Yet he reached out his hand to me,|\n|Kann dir die Hand nicht geben|I cannot take your hand, right now|\n|Bleib du im ew'gen Leben|May you rest there, in eternal life|\n \nPrussia has sometimes been described as [not a country with an army, but an army with a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army#:~:text=The%20social%20classes%20were%20all,an%20army%20with%20a%20country%22.). This lead to many great military victories for Prussia, but\nalso immense loss for the soldiers on the battlefield. The line that particularly stands\nout is \"As if he were part of me\", because it depicts the tight bond that forms between\nsoldiers on the battlfield. The singer and his comrade are so close that theey feel\nphysically attached.\n\nOn a more uplifiting note, the next song we will look at is [Palästinalied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UBQArOa5c), a song based on a poem from the 13th century.\n|German|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Nû lebe ich mir alrêrst werde,| Now I live only worthy|\n|sît mîn sündic ouge sihet| Since my sinful eye sees|\n|daz hêre lant und ouch die erde,| The pure land and also the earth|\n|der man vil der êren gihet.| which is worshipped so much|\n\nYou can almost hear the wonder coming from this song. I like to imagine a knight who has\nheard so much about Jerusalem finally arriving and praising what he sees. Even though, this\nsong still remains a tone solumn and humble (\"sinful eye sees\"). It's almost like\nthe author is humbled by being in such a special place. \n \n \n# France\nNow onto a nation bording Germany, which is France. I have recently taken a liking\nto the song [Vive Henri IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MFBD15ehjA)\n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Au diable guerres,|To hell with wars,\n|Rancunes et partis !|Grudges and partisanship!|\n|Comme nos pères|Like our fathers|\n|Chantons en vrais amis,|Let us sing as true friends,\n|Au choc des verres,|Clink the glasses,|\n|Les roses et les lys.|The roses and the lilies.|\n\nAside from having a really spritely melody, the lyrics also have a fun and playful nature.\nIt has a message of celebration, not only of the honourable monarch [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), but also of the festivites. I reccomend singing this song\nat your next party.\n\nWe will next study [Seigneurs, Sachiez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s), which\nwas amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing\nsuch a good song? \n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça| All the bad people will stay behind|\n|qui n'aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.| those who don't love God, honor, or pray to Him|\n|Et chascuns dit: \"Ma feme, que fera?| And some say \"what will my wife do?|\n|Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!\"| I will not leave without my friends\"|\n|Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,|These men have fallen into foolish concerns|\n|qu'il n'est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,| For man has no friends except|\n|qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.| He who was put on the true cross for our sake|\n\nI imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.\nAs a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far\naway and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his\nmessage. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading (\"what will my \nwife do?\"), and then explains why these concerns are not valid. \n\n# Britain\nBritain is a country close to my heart, and it also has some very good songs.\nThe first song is [My England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU123EhCjBA)\n\n### My England\nBorn and raised in a laying land  \nThe guardian of the islands  \nWhere the rolling hills and the mountain streams  \nmeet the sweet sweet peace of the highlands  \nOh how I love my motherland, this blessed land of freedom  \nWhere every heart that shares her peace, feels the glory of her Eden  \nAnd she lifts up my soul like a bright sunny day  \nand she stays in my life like a song  \n\nThese expressive lyrics capture the beauty of the English countryside. I can almost imagine \\\nthe green pastures of Yorkshire when I listen to this song.\n\nAnd I would be remissed not to mention the most famous British historical song: [The British\nGrenadiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrxHO-B2TY)\n\n### The British Grenadiers\nSome talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules  \nOf Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.  \nBut of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare.  \nWith a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.  \n\nI do like the sophisticated swagger and bravado of this song. It's has the confident tone\nof dismissing these heros of antiquity. From the first bars, we can tell from this self-confidence\nthat this is going to be a fun and uplifting song. \n\n# Yugoslavia\nThere is a very good video [\"My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg) that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason\nwhy Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,\nwhere 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages\nare all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.\nThey accomplished this through music. First, we will look at [My Dad is a War Criminal!\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8).\n\n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Moj je tata zločinac iz rata|My dad is a war criminal \n|Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite|You can try condemning him|\n|Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda |But no one has the balls to arrest him |\n\nApparantly this song is satire of the UN, who called Serbia war criminals. Honestly,\nit's a really funny song because it contains an unsual topic. I don't know any other\nsongs where the singer just openly admits war crimes. \nThe next song we will look at is [Crni Bombarderi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333OVHhpK5c).\nIt's by Roki Vulovic, who has many other great songs you should also check out. \n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Da li je to istina ili se samo šališ|Is it the truth or are you just joking ?|\n|Na Balkanu hoćeš vatru da zapališ|You want to start a fire on the balkans| \n|Prijatelju stari iz prošloga rata|Old friend from the previous war|\n|Stavićeš i sebi omcu oko vrata|You'll put the rope around your own neck|\n|Sa Srbima ne smije inat da se tera|Don't pick a fight with the defiant serbs|\n|Izgubićeš jato crnih bombardera|You'll lose your swarm of black bombers|\n\nThis song refers to the [1999 F-117A shootdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown)\nincident. The US had the most advanced stealth technology in the world, and said\ntheir bomber was invisible. The Serbs had obselete Soviet missile technology,\nyet still managed to shoot down the plane.  They said [\"Sorry we didn't know it was invisible\"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_poster_%22Sorry_we_didn%27t_know_it_was_invisible%22.jpg).\nI think that's a pretty amazing story, and the story is reflected in the lyrics of the song.\n\n# Conclusion\nI am trying to expand my collection of historical music. If you have any historical\nsongs that you want me to add to this blog or that you want me to know about,\nplease [contact me](/contact).\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n","date":"April 11, 2022","tags":["History"," Music"],"title":"What Can We Learn from Historical Music?","slug":"historical-music","description":"We can glean a lot from music.","image":"/images/Theobald_I.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"decidability-tradeoff"},"buildId":"zmvxfQSYrn1n5EWYorAqv","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
