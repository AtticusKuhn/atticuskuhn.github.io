he says that we&#x27;ve &quot;basically discovered all the programming paradigms&quot;. He says this due to his
view that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.
My view is that <strong>a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model
of computation</strong>. I will explain what I mean.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Models of Computation</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Model of Computation</a> is
&quot;a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input&quot;.
There are a list of models of computation on the page, which include</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Post machines</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Pushdown automata</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Register machines</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Random-access machines</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Turing machines</li>
<li index="5" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Decision tree model</li>
<li index="6" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Abstract rewriting systems</li>
<li index="7" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Combinatory logic</li>
<li index="8" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">General recursive functions</li>
<li index="9" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Lambda calculus</li>
<li index="10" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Actor model</li>
<li index="11" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Cellular automaton</li>
<li index="12" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Interaction nets</li>
<li index="13" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Kahn process networks</li>
<li index="14" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Logic gates and digital circuits</li>
<li index="15" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Petri nets</li>
<li index="16" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Synchronous Data Flow</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many models of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Minimal Addition</h1>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;minimal additon&quot;. Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means
some abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold
standard for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Haskell</a>, with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such
as Haskell&#x27;s monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Examples of Well-Loved Languages</h1>
<p>I will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good
models of computation.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Model of Computation</th><th>Language</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Untyped Lambda Calculus</td><td>Lisp</td></tr><tr><td>Typed Lambda Calculus</td><td>Haskell</td></tr><tr><td>Predicate Logic</td><td>Prolog</td></tr><tr><td>Rewriting System</td><td>Wolfram</td></tr><tr><td>Actor Model</td><td>Smalltalk</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction Nets</td><td><a href="https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Kind2</a></td></tr><tr><td>Combinatory Logic</td><td>APL</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.
And what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">minimal wrapper</a> on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features
beyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference
between Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Actor Model</a>
but Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly
borrows concepts from other languages.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Turing Completeness</h1>
<p>Due to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.
So, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model
that is the best for our needs.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Good Models of Computation</h1>
<p>Given all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?
I think it comes down to 2 critera:</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">being simple</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">having nice properties</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">SK Calculus</a> is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model
of computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of
a model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain.</p>
<p>For the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and
fast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Interaction Nets</a> because they have these properties</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">strong confluence</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing
an implementation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Advice to Aspiring Language Designers</h1>
<p>If you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to
choose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would
not design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected
by Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because
Prolog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can
be executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right
now I think the field of Linear Logic doesn&#x27;t have its own industry-strength programming
language. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.</p>

Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating.
