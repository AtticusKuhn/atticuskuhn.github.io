he says that we&#x27;ve &quot;basically discovered all the programming paradigms&quot;. He says this due to his
view that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.
My view is that <strong>a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model
of computation</strong>. I will explain what I mean.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Models of Computation</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Model of Computation</a> is
&quot;a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input&quot;.
There are a list of models of computation on the page, which include</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Post machines</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Pushdown automata</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Register machines</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Random-access machines</li>

<li index="15" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Petri nets</li>
<li index="16" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Synchronous Data Flow</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many models of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Minimal Addition</h1>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;minimal additon&quot;. Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means
some abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold
standard for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Haskell</a>, with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such
as Haskell&#x27;s monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Examples of Well-Loved Languages</h1>
<p>I will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good
models of computation.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Model of Computation</th><th>Language</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Untyped Lambda Calculus</td><td>Lisp</td></tr><tr><td>Typed Lambda Calculus</td><td>Haskell</td></tr><tr><td>Predicate Logic</td><td>Prolog</td></tr><tr><td>Rewriting System</td><td>Wolfram</td></tr><tr><td>Actor Model</td><td>Smalltalk</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction Nets</td><td><a href="https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Kind2</a></td></tr><tr><td>Combinatory Logic</td><td>APL</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.
And what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">minimal wrapper</a> on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features
beyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference
between Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Actor Model</a>
but Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly
borrows concepts from other languages.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Turing Completeness</h1>
<p>Due to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.
So, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model
that is the best for our needs.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Good Models of Computation</h1>
<p>Given all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?
I think it comes down to 2 critera:</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">being simple</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">having nice properties</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">SK Calculus</a> is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model
of computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of
a model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain.</p>
<p>For the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and
fast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Interaction Nets</a> because they have these properties</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">strong confluence</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing
an implementation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Advice to Aspiring Language Designers</h1>
<p>If you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to
choose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would
not design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected
by Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because
Prolog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can
be executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right
now I think the field of Linear Logic doesn&#x27;t have its own industry-strength programming
language. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.</p>

Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},{"content":"\n\n# What is Undecidability\n\nLike Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system\nwill eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability. Decidability\nbasically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. [Adding Numbers](https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary) is decidable but [finding the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in\nall systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more\nrules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?\nI will start with a few examples\n\n# Typing Systems for Programming Languages\n\nI first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically\nan algorithm that says `5` is an integer or `[1,2,3]` is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by [Algorithm W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W). A type system is very useful,\nbut people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they\ntry to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of \n[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)'s [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), you might realise that the type of the second\nargument depends on the type of the first argument.\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%f %s\", 1.2, \"hello\")\n```\nIf you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered\ndependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently\ntyped program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)). One you say you want this, you have stepped out\nof the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler\nusing a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A good documentation of this problem is on the website [typing is hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html).\n\nIn my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don't want\nto have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.\n\n# Presbuger Arithmetic\n\nAnother beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is [Presburger Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic). Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic\nwhere every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say \n`x+y \u003e 10` and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?\nThere is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.\nSo statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And\nOnce we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.\n\n# Undecidability is Interesting\n\nUnlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do **not**\nwant decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no\ninteresting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between\nexpressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose\ninteresting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,\ntruth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is \ntrue, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses\nall its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn't so bad.\n\n# Walking off the Cliff\n\nWhat can you take away from this? Well let's say you're designing a programming tool like\na configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,\nunwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,\nwhere now they are [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete) (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to\nkeep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that\nmight cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability. \n\n\n","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["automata"," decidability"," presbuger arithmetic"," type system"],"title":"The Decidability Tradeoff","slug":"decidability-tradeoff","description":"There is a fine line between power and decidability","image":"/images/automata.jpeg"},{"content":"\n\nSince haskell is a list-based language, there are many ways to work with lists.

The boring way\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs = map (\\x-\u003ex*5) xs\n```\n3. currying\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList = map (*5) \n```\n4. monad\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs =  xs \u003e\u003e= (\\x -\u003e [x*5])\n```\n5. short functor\n```haskell,\nm=(\u003c$\u003e)(*5)\n```\n6. List comprehension\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs = [x*5 | x \u003c- xs]\n```\n\n\n7. Do notation\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs = do\n    x \u003c- xs\n    return $ x*5\n```\n\n8. Functor\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs = fmap (\\x -\u003e x*5) xs\n```\n9. Applicative\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList xs =  pure (\\x-\u003ex*5) \u003c*\u003e xs\n```\n10. Recursion\n```haskell,\nmultiplyList :: [Int] -\u003e [Int]\nmultiplyList [] = []\nmultiplyList (x:xs) = (x*5) : multiplyList xs\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","date":"May 2, 2021","tags":["haskell"," list"," map"," functor"],"title":"10 ways to map a list in haskell","slug":"10-ways-to-map-a-list","description":"Haskell is such a cool language","image":"/images/techs/haskell.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"create-language"},"buildId":"Xozn3mTXFO_3WIwREEH5h","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
