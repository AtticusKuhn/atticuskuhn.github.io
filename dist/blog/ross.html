I would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that
the Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Math</h1>
<p>On the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that
the Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in
number theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think
that proving that if a is divisible by b, then b &lt; a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,
we go <strong>FULL RIGOR</strong>, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal
inference or hand waving (the student&#x27;s response: &quot;full rigor leads to rigor mortis&quot;). All the problem
sets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Counsellors</h1>
<p>All the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say &quot;I have a math problem&quot; and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are
graded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person &quot;family&quot; with a consellor creates a sense
of camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Lectures</h1>
<p>Special lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">OSU</a>. These are
very exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms
to computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson&#x27;s Pigeonhole lecture series in
the first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened
my conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar&#x27;s talk on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">hyper-reals</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Community</h1>
<p>The community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it
is quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math.
We all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel
that the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that <strong>it prepares you for how life will be in
university</strong>. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people
in a similar major to discuss your shared passion.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Food</h1>
<p>I&#x27;d rather not dwell on this subject for too long.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Tips</h1>
<p>If you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">learn how to use a washing machine before you go</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">bring some emergency food with you</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal"><strong>pro tip:</strong> bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring
a sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over
who say up very late and you don&#x27;t want to be kept awake</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">The Ross website may claim that you shouldn&#x27;t bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but
you will probably be fine if you bring these things.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Should you go to Ross?</h1>
<p>If you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply
to the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math
before, but I really liked the experience.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/complex-analysis"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Complex Analysis is Super Cool" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/complex-analysis.png"/><div class="font-bold">Complex Analysis is Super Cool</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">it&#x27;s my favorite field of mathematics</div></div></a><a href="/blog/sandeep-interview"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Interview with Machine Learning Expert" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/sandeep.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Interview with Machine Learning Expert</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">After his 30 years in the field, machine learning engineer Sandeep Srinivasan offers advice on how to tackle this complex career.</div></div></a><a href="/blog/promise-is-a-monad"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why promise IS a monad" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/monad.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Why promise IS a monad</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">There are monads all around us, even if we don&#x27;t notice it</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>Ⓒ all rights reserved <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review.

While most have gravitated towards it since the hype of the late 2000s, Srinivasan claims he has been “interested in machine learning since the 1990s,” almost noachian in this quickly evolving field. Today, I sat down with Srinivasan in order to glean what insights he has after pioneering this industry for 30 years. \n\nI am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn. \n\nFinding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.\n\nDespite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients. \n\nThe main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge. \n\t\nDoctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning. I suggest to the reader to conduct a similar informational interview, in the hopes that one could learn about an intriguing field from a personality. \n\n\n \n","date":"Feb 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," interview"," coding"],"title":"Interview with Machine Learning Expert","slug":"sandeep-interview","description":"After his 30 years in the field, machine learning engineer Sandeep Srinivasan offers advice on how to tackle this complex career.","image":"/images/sandeep.jpg"},{"content":"\nBecause I program in haskell, I have a lot of experience with monads, and now I see monads wherever I go. Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) =\u003e t (m a) -\u003e m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -\u003e promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs \u003e\u003e=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (\u003e\u003e=) :: Monad m =\u003e m a -\u003e (a -\u003e m b) -\u003e m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=\u003e data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator \u003e\u003e= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that \u003e\u003e= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (\u003e\u003e=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ross"},"buildId":"tfNk63Urr_rp8zvI0XuhL","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
