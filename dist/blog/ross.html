I would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that
the Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Math</h1>
<p>On the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that
the Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in
number theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think
that proving that if a is divisible by b, then b &lt; a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,
we go <strong>FULL RIGOR</strong>, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal
inference or hand waving (the student&#x27;s response: &quot;full rigor leads to rigor mortis&quot;). All the problem
sets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Counsellors</h1>
<p>All the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say &quot;I have a math problem&quot; and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are
graded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person &quot;family&quot; with a consellor creates a sense
of camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Lectures</h1>
<p>Special lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">OSU</a>. These are
very exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms
to computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson&#x27;s Pigeonhole lecture series in
the first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened
my conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar&#x27;s talk on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">hyper-reals</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Community</h1>
<p>The community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it
is quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math.
We all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel
that the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that <strong>it prepares you for how life will be in
university</strong>. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people
in a similar major to discuss your shared passion.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Food</h1>
<p>I&#x27;d rather not dwell on this subject for too long.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Tips</h1>
<p>If you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">learn how to use a washing machine before you go</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">bring some emergency food with you</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal"><strong>pro tip:</strong> bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring
a sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over
who say up very late and you don&#x27;t want to be kept awake</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">The Ross website may claim that you shouldn&#x27;t bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but
you will probably be fine if you bring these things.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Should you go to Ross?</h1>
<p>If you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply
to the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math
before, but I really liked the experience.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4"><a href="/blog/boolHarmful"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Boolean Considered Harmful" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/babBools.png"/><div class="font-bold">Boolean Considered Harmful</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Most uses of Boolean are wrong</div></div></a><a href="/blog/javascript-bad"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Javascript Being Bad is why it&#x27;s Good" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/techs/javascript.png"/><div class="font-bold">Javascript Being Bad is why it&#x27;s Good</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons</div></div></a><a href="/blog/machine-learning-overrated"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Machine Learning is overrated" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Machine Learning is overrated</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I don&#x27;t understand the hype around machine learning</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span><a href="/rss.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">RSS feed</a> |<a href="/atom.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">atom feed</a> |<a href="/rss.json" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">JSON feed</a> | MIT License <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review.

This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad. Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},{"content":"\nIn recent years, we've seen a lot of hype around machine learning. From [alpha go](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), which beat world-champion go\nplayers, to [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the constant news buzz\nwould make one think we are around the corner from [AI Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But I claim today that most of AI is just hype, with no\nreal substance behind it. Of course time will tell the true use of AI. In fact, most\ntimes teams eagerly throw a [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) at\na problem, they are really looking for a symbolic manipulation tool like [prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\n\n# Black Boxes\n\nThe first drawback of machine learning is they are incomprehensible. If a machine learning model\nmakes a mistake, how will you figure out what went wrong? There is no real way of knowing. Sure,\nyou can look at the internal state of the model, but what does that really tell you?\nModels today are getting so large that it is impossible to hold a single one in your\nbrain. GPT-3 has [175 billion parameters](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai/#:~:text=The%20largest%20version%20GPT%2D3,and%203.2%20M%20batch%20size.\u0026text=Shown%20in%20the%20figure%20above,that%20it%20is%20quite%20larger.)\nparameters. What if it makes a mistake? Will some engineer have to go through all\n175 billion parameters just to find it? I think the true solution is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) software\nthat simply states rules or definitions. That code is easier to debug and understand for\nnew users. In essence, we can only look at machine learning as a black box.\n\n# Changing Requirements\n\nOften in software engineering, projects are subject to [changing requirements](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/help-the-requirements-keep-changing-and-i-cant-nail-them-down-part-2/).\nWhat happens when this is done to a machine learning model? In short, I don't\nsee how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on\na slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model\nevery time you want to make a change. Google even spoke about this issue in their\npaper [Machine Learning:\nThe High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf). In our ever-changing world, you must truly\nconsider if you want to use a technology that requires so much effort even to change\nits purpose slightly.\n\n# Declarative Programming: is it Nirvana?\n\nI am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language) or from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\nIn such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and\nthe language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand\nbecause it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand\nthe behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never\nheard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other\nprogramming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage.
