The History of Javascript
Looking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Opinionated vs Flexible</h1>
<p>The core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let&#x27;s say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it&#x27;s better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4"><a href="/blog/rss"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why RSS Feeds are the Superior way to Stay Up-to-Date" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/rss.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Why RSS Feeds are the Superior way to Stay Up-to-Date</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I just started using an RSS feed</div></div></a><a href="/blog/create-language"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/lisp.png"/><div class="font-bold">How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I have come up with a method to design well-loved languages</div></div></a><a href="/blog/why-i-love-vim"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why I love VIM" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/vim.png"/><div class="font-bold">Why I love VIM</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Vim is arguable the best text editor</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span><a href="/rss.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">RSS feed</a> |<a href="/atom.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">atom feed</a> |<a href="/rss.json" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">JSON feed</a> | MIT License <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad.

RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.

He says this due to his\nview that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.\nMy view is that **a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model\nof computation**. I will explain what I mean.\n\n## Models of Computation\nAccording to Wikipedia, a [Model of Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) is\n\"a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input\".\nThere are a list of models of computation on the page, which include\n- Post machines\n- Pushdown automata\n- Register machines\n- Random-access machines\n- Turing machines\n- Decision tree model\n- Abstract rewriting systems\n- Combinatory logic\n- General recursive functions\n- Lambda calculus\n- Actor model\n- Cellular automaton\n- Interaction nets\n- Kahn process networks\n- Logic gates and digital circuits\n- Petri nets\n- Synchronous Data Flow\n\nAs you can see, there are many models of computation.\n## Minimal Addition\nWhat do I mean by \"minimal additon\". Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means\nsome abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold\nstandard for this is [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell), with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such\nas Haskell's monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.\n\n## Examples of Well-Loved Languages\n\nI will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good\nmodels of computation.\n\n\n| Model of Computation| Language|\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Untyped Lambda Calculus | Lisp|\n| Typed Lambda Calculus | Haskell|\n| Predicate Logic | Prolog |\n| Rewriting System | Wolfram |\n| Actor Model | Smalltalk |\n| Interaction Nets | [Kind2](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2) |\n| Combinatory Logic | APL | \n\nHopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.\nAnd what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.\n\nLet us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the [minimal wrapper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782) on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features\nbeyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference\nbetween Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)\nbut Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly\nborrows concepts from other languages.\n\n## Turing Completeness\nDue to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.\nSo, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model\nthat is the best for our needs.\n\n## Good Models of Computation\nGiven all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?\nI think it comes down to 2 critera:\n- being simple\n- having nice properties\n\nFor the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the [SK Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus) is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model\nof computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of\na model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain. \n\nFor the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and\nfast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is [Interaction Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties) because they have these properties\n\n- locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)\n- linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)\n- strong confluence \n\nThese properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing\nan implementation.\n\n\n## Advice to Aspiring Language Designers\nIf you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to\nchoose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would\nnot design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected\nby Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because\nProlog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can\nbe executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right\nnow I think the field of Linear Logic doesn't have its own industry-strength programming\nlanguage. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.\n\n\n## Summary\nIn short, a programming language is nothing but an implentation of a model of computation.","date":"Oct 10, 2022","tags":["programming"," math"," computation"," lisp"],"title":"How to Create an Excellent Programming Lanugage","slug":"create-language","description":"I have come up with a method to design well-loved languages","image":"/images/lisp.png"},{"content":"\n\nThe text editor VIM is possibly one of my favourite tools for developing and coding.
