Why is Javascript perceived as bad?
To see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of
weak typing</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-4xl font-bold p-1">general weirdness</h1>
<p>I find many of the criticisms of javascript are &quot;why doesn&#x27;t this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot&quot;. These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript.
The History of Javascript
Looking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-4xl font-bold p-1">Opinionated vs Flexible</h1>
<p>The core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let&#x27;s say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it&#x27;s better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled.</p></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/machine-learning-overrated"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Machine Learning is overrated" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Machine Learning is overrated</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I don&#x27;t understand the hype around machine learning</div></div></a><a href="/blog/complex-analysis"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Complex Analysis is Super Cool" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/complex-analysis.png"/><div class="font-bold">Complex Analysis is Super Cool</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">it&#x27;s my favorite field of mathematics</div></div></a><a href="/blog/10-ways-to-map-a-list"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="10 ways to map a list in haskell" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/techs/haskell.png"/><div class="font-bold">10 ways to map a list in haskell</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Haskell is such a cool language</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>â’¸ all rights reserved Atticus Kuhn <!-- -->2022</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad.
