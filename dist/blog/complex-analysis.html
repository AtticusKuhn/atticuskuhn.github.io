I eventually\nfigured out that it was an issue with Intel Graphics, so I fixed it.\n\nMy experience was a bit slow and clunky starting out, but eventually, I became faster after I'd learning\nall the tricks of the new software. I actually think I am faster and more efficient now because open-source\nsoftware tends to follow the Unix Philosophy of being modular and also has lots of modes and keybindings\nto speed things up. \n\n# Software I've used\n\nThe thing I like most about free software is that it seems such software gives ultimate control and\ncustomizability to the user.

From [alpha go](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), which beat world-champion go\nplayers, to [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the constant news buzz\nwould make one think we are around the corner from [AI Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But I claim today that most of AI is just hype, with no\nreal substance behind it. Of course time will tell the true use of AI. In fact, most\ntimes teams eagerly throw a [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) at\na problem, they are really looking for a symbolic manipulation tool like [prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\n\n# Black Boxes\n\nThe first drawback of machine learning is they are incomprehensible. If a machine learning model\nmakes a mistake, how will you figure out what went wrong? There is no real way of knowing. Sure,\nyou can look at the internal state of the model, but what does that really tell you?\nModels today are getting so large that it is impossible to hold a single one in your\nbrain. GPT-3 has [175 billion parameters](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai/#:~:text=The%20largest%20version%20GPT%2D3,and%203.2%20M%20batch%20size.\u0026text=Shown%20in%20the%20figure%20above,that%20it%20is%20quite%20larger.)\nparameters. What if it makes a mistake? Will some engineer have to go through all\n175 billion parameters just to find it? I think the true solution is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) software\nthat simply states rules or definitions. That code is easier to debug and understand for\nnew users. In essence, we can only look at machine learning as a black box.\n\n# Changing Requirements\n\nOften in software engineering, projects are subject to [changing requirements](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/help-the-requirements-keep-changing-and-i-cant-nail-them-down-part-2/).\nWhat happens when this is done to a machine learning model? In short, I don't\nsee how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on\na slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model\nevery time you want to make a change. Google even spoke about this issue in their\npaper [Machine Learning:\nThe High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf). In our ever-changing world, you must truly\nconsider if you want to use a technology that requires so much effort even to change\nits purpose slightly.\n\n# Declarative Programming: is it Nirvana?\n\nI am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language) or from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\nIn such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and\nthe language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand\nbecause it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand\nthe behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never\nheard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other\nprogramming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage. It will rethink the way\nthat you understand the purpose of computers, [so try it out](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).","date":"January 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," ml"," AI"],"title":"Machine Learning is overrated","slug":"machine-learning-overrated","description":"I don't understand the hype around machine learning","image":"/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"},{"content":"\n\nWith so many different programming languages and technologies available today, it can sometimes be confusing on which to choose for a new project. If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"complex-analysis"},"buildId":"ek3rVVU7WPblT5f9hcwZp","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
