Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of\ncontent has a two-fold benefit\n\n* As you write more, you will become better at writing\n\n* By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on\nyour site.\n\nHonestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites. \nOf course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),\nyet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing\nlong articles\n\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI hope I have given some unconventional advice on how to start a personal site. If\nyou want to hear more about this topic, feel free to [contact me](/contact).","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["personal site"," html"," react"," blog"," markdown blog"],"title":"Tips for Creating a Personal Site","slug":"create-personal-site","description":"If you are thinking about creating a personal site, I have advice","image":"/images/personal-identity.jpg"},{"content":"\n\nWith so many different programming languages and technologies available today, it can sometimes be confusing on which to choose for a new project. If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\nThe text editor VIM is possibly one of my favourite tools for developing and coding. Whenever I have the opportunity to use vim, from VS code to Overleaf, and even google docs, I take it. I just want more people to learn and use VIM because of what an enjoyable tool is\n\n# Macros\nMany people often waste time slaving away at menial and boring text editing tasks. Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again. There is something immensely satisfying about executing the proper algorithm in VIM which I strive for every time I code. \n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["vim"],"title":"Why I love VIM","slug":"why-i-love-vim","description":"Vim is arguable the best text editor","image":"/images/vim.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"complex-analysis"},"buildId":"ib2KD7WJ2rv6_5lfqK1GB","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
