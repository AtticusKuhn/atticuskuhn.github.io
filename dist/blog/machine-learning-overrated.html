see how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on
a slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model

<p>I am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Wolfram Language</a> or from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Prolog</a>.
In such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and
the language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand
because it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand
the behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never
heard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other
programming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage. It will rethink the way

I am especially excited as to how it turned out and I always wanted to make a personal site for myself to display my projects. I built this site using next JS and posting it on GitHub pages.I hope you take the time to look at my blog posts and projects which are on this site \n","date":"April 5, 2021","tags":["blog"," javascript"," github"],"title":"The Start of My Blog","slug":"start","description":"my first blog","image":"/images/start.jpg"},{"content":"\n\n# My Site\nAs I have created a personal site (you're looking at it right now), I feel somewhat\nqualified to give advice to others on the best way of creating a personal site. Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of\ncontent has a two-fold benefit\n\n* As you write more, you will become better at writing\n\n* By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on\nyour site.\n\nHonestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites. \nOf course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),\nyet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing\nlong articles\n\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI hope I have given some unconventional advice on how to start a personal site.
