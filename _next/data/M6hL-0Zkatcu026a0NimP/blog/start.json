Whenever I have the opportunity to use vim, from VS code to Overleaf, and even google docs, I take it. I just want more people to learn and use VIM because of what an enjoyable tool is\n\n# Macros\nMany people often waste time slaving away at menial and boring text editing tasks. Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again. There is something immensely satisfying about executing the proper algorithm in VIM which I strive for every time I code. \n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["vim"],"title":"Why I love VIM","slug":"why-i-love-vim","description":"Vim is arguable the best text editor","image":"/images/vim.png"},{"content":"\n\n# Linux\n\nI recently began to experiment with trying Linux, a free and open source operating system.

I have been interested in history for a long time, and if you are also interested\nin history, then I think that music is uniquely positioned to gain an understanding of the past.\nHumans have been creating music for [at least 3500 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tfBLvlN98),\nand probably longer, so there seems to be something intrisic to humans about creating music.\nFurthermore, since most songs are short (on the order of 5 minutes), we must distill our soul\nand essence into a simple and memorable phrase in order to be musical. This desire creates brevity,\nwhich can easily help us gain the gist of a historical society. This need is amplified\nby folk music, which is designed to be easily sung by large groups of people, so is often\nmelodically and lyrically simple (simple does not necessarily mean bad). These are the\nhistorical societies I will analyze through the lens of music\n\n\n# Soviet Union / Russia\nThe first song we will look at is [Swallowing Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAoibAgAvM).\nBelow I have posted the lyrics:\n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|Да один, я остался один |yes, I was alone|\n|а все друзья мои полегли,|and all my friends perished,|\n|Вся надежда – один магазин|all hope is on one magazine|\n|просто так не возьмёте, скоты!| But you won't take me that easy, brutes!|\n\nWe can see that the Russians fight till the end with resourcefullness (\"But you won't take me that easy\"). I think this is in keeping with Russian character. Looking at [Russian History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia), it is certainly brutal. This song portrays Russian\nstoicism and bravery in the face of hardships, but another song shows the other face of\nthe coin. [Don't Tell Mom I'm In Chechnya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHCzaiJEoEY)\nis a more depressing song about a soldier lamenting and cursing the horrors of the\nChechnyan War. \n\n| Russian      | English |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|С другом Саней что он вернется держу пари|I made a bet with my friend Sanya, that he will return|\n|Ты только маме что я в Чечне не говори.|Just don't tell mom that I'm in Chechnya.|\n\nThe dark truth is that if the singer made a bet against Sanya that he will come back, that\nimplies that Sanya bet he would die. In the hard history of Russia, I imagine that a\nbit of morbid humour would be necessary to survive and make sense of it. \n\n\n# Germany\nThe next culture we will look at the songs of is Germany. One especially moving song is\n[Ich Hatt' Einen Kameraden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1Z1y2PSNw).\n\n| German | English|\n| ------ | -------|\n|Er liegt vor meinen Füßen|Now he lies here at my feet|\n|Als wär's ein Stück von mir|As if he were part of me|\n|Will mir die Hand noch reichen,|Yet he reached out his hand to me,|\n|Kann dir die Hand nicht geben|I cannot take your hand, right now|\n|Bleib du im ew'gen Leben|May you rest there, in eternal life|\n \nPrussia has sometimes been described as [not a country with an army, but an army with a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army#:~:text=The%20social%20classes%20were%20all,an%20army%20with%20a%20country%22.). This lead to many great military victories for Prussia, but\nalso immense loss for the soldiers on the battlefield. The line that particularly stands\nout is \"As if he were part of me\", because it depicts the tight bond that forms between\nsoldiers on the battlfield. The singer and his comrade are so close that theey feel\nphysically attached.\n\nOn a more uplifiting note, the next song we will look at is [Palästinalied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UBQArOa5c), a song based on a poem from the 13th century.\n|German|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Nû lebe ich mir alrêrst werde,| Now I live only worthy|\n|sît mîn sündic ouge sihet| Since my sinful eye sees|\n|daz hêre lant und ouch die erde,| The pure land and also the earth|\n|der man vil der êren gihet.| which is worshipped so much|\n\nYou can almost hear the wonder coming from this song. I like to imagine a knight who has\nheard so much about Jerusalem finally arriving and praising what he sees. Even though, this\nsong still remains a tone solumn and humble (\"sinful eye sees\"). It's almost like\nthe author is humbled by being in such a special place. \n \n \n# France\nNow onto a nation bording Germany, which is France. I have recently taken a liking\nto the song [Vive Henri IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MFBD15ehjA)\n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Au diable guerres,|To hell with wars,\n|Rancunes et partis !|Grudges and partisanship!|\n|Comme nos pères|Like our fathers|\n|Chantons en vrais amis,|Let us sing as true friends,\n|Au choc des verres,|Clink the glasses,|\n|Les roses et les lys.|The roses and the lilies.|\n\nAside from having a really spritely melody, the lyrics also have a fun and playful nature.\nIt has a message of celebration, not only of the honourable monarch [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), but also of the festivites. I reccomend singing this song\nat your next party.\n\nWe will next study [Seigneurs, Sachiez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s), which\nwas amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing\nsuch a good song? \n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça| All the bad people will stay behind|\n|qui n'aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.| those who don't love God, honor, or pray to Him|\n|Et chascuns dit: \"Ma feme, que fera?| And some say \"what will my wife do?|\n|Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!\"| I will not leave without my friends\"|\n|Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,|These men have fallen into foolish concerns|\n|qu'il n'est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,| For man has no friends except|\n|qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.| He who was put on the true cross for our sake|\n\nI imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.\nAs a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far\naway and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his\nmessage. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading (\"what will my \nwife do?\"), and then explains why these concerns are not valid. \n\n# Britain\nBritain is a country close to my heart, and it also has some very good songs.\nThe first song is [My England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU123EhCjBA)\n\n### My England\nBorn and raised in a laying land  \nThe guardian of the islands  \nWhere the rolling hills and the mountain streams  \nmeet the sweet sweet peace of the highlands  \nOh how I love my motherland, this blessed land of freedom  \nWhere every heart that shares her peace, feels the glory of her Eden  \nAnd she lifts up my soul like a bright sunny day  \nand she stays in my life like a song  \n\nThese expressive lyrics capture the beauty of the English countryside. I can almost imagine \\\nthe green pastures of Yorkshire when I listen to this song.\n\nAnd I would be remissed not to mention the most famous British historical song: [The British\nGrenadiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrxHO-B2TY)\n\n### The British Grenadiers\nSome talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules  \nOf Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.  \nBut of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare.  \nWith a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.  \n\nI do like the sophisticated swagger and bravado of this song. It's has the confident tone\nof dismissing these heros of antiquity. From the first bars, we can tell from this self-confidence\nthat this is going to be a fun and uplifting song. \n\n# Yugoslavia\nThere is a very good video [\"My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg) that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason\nwhy Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,\nwhere 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages\nare all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.\nThey accomplished this through music. First, we will look at [My Dad is a War Criminal!\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8).\n\n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Moj je tata zločinac iz rata|My dad is a war criminal \n|Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite|You can try condemning him|\n|Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda |But no one has the balls to arrest him |\n\nApparantly this song is satire of the UN, who called Serbia war criminals. Honestly,\nit's a really funny song because it contains an unsual topic. I don't know any other\nsongs where the singer just openly admits war crimes. \nThe next song we will look at is [Crni Bombarderi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333OVHhpK5c).\nIt's by Roki Vulovic, who has many other great songs you should also check out. \n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Da li je to istina ili se samo šališ|Is it the truth or are you just joking ?|\n|Na Balkanu hoćeš vatru da zapališ|You want to start a fire on the balkans| \n|Prijatelju stari iz prošloga rata|Old friend from the previous war|\n|Stavićeš i sebi omcu oko vrata|You'll put the rope around your own neck|\n|Sa Srbima ne smije inat da se tera|Don't pick a fight with the defiant serbs|\n|Izgubićeš jato crnih bombardera|You'll lose your swarm of black bombers|\n\nThis song refers to the [1999 F-117A shootdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown)\nincident. The US had the most advanced stealth technology in the world, and said\ntheir bomber was invisible. The Serbs had obselete Soviet missile technology,\nyet still managed to shoot down the plane.  They said [\"Sorry we didn't know it was invisible\"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_poster_%22Sorry_we_didn%27t_know_it_was_invisible%22.jpg).\nI think that's a pretty amazing story, and the story is reflected in the lyrics of the song.\n\n# Conclusion\nI am trying to expand my collection of historical music. If you have any historical\nsongs that you want me to add to this blog or that you want me to know about,\nplease [contact me](/contact).\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n","date":"April 11, 2022","tags":["History"," Music"],"title":"What Can We Learn from Historical Music?","slug":"historical-music","description":"We can glean a lot from music.","image":"/images/Theobald_I.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
