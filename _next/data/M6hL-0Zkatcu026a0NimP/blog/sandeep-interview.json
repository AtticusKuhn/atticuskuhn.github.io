{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\nSandeep Srinivasan is a veteran of the machine learning industry. While most have gravitated towards it since the hype of the late 2000s, Srinivasan claims he has been “interested in machine learning since the 1990s,” almost noachian in this quickly evolving field. Today, I sat down with Srinivasan in order to glean what insights he has after pioneering this industry for 30 years. \n\nI am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn. \n\nFinding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.\n\nDespite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients. \n\nThe main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge. \n\t\nDoctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning. I suggest to the reader to conduct a similar informational interview, in the hopes that one could learn about an intriguing field from a personality. \n\n\n \n","date":"Feb 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," interview"," coding"],"title":"Interview with Machine Learning Expert","slug":"sandeep-interview","description":"After his 30 years in the field, machine learning engineer Sandeep Srinivasan offers advice on how to tackle this complex career.","image":"/images/sandeep.jpg"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\n\n\n# Boolean Considered Harmful\n\nI make the claim that using the boolean type (called \"Boolean\")\nis always a bad design decesion. This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\n# My Site\nAs I have created a personal site (you're looking at it right now), I feel somewhat\nqualified to give advice to others on the best way of creating a personal site. Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of\ncontent has a two-fold benefit\n\n* As you write more, you will become better at writing\n\n* By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on\nyour site.\n\nHonestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites. \nOf course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),\nyet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing\nlong articles\n\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI hope I have given some unconventional advice on how to start a personal site.

Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => t (m a) -> m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -> promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs >>=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=> data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator >>= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that >>= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (>>=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
