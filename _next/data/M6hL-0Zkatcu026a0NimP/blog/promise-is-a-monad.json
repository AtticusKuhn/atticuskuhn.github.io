{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\nBecause I program in haskell, I have a lot of experience with monads, and now I see monads wherever I go. Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => t (m a) -> m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -> promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs >>=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=> data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator >>= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that >>= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (>>=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\n\nWith so many different programming languages and technologies available today, it can sometimes be confusing on which to choose for a new project. If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\n\n# Boolean Considered Harmful\n\nI make the claim that using the boolean type (called \"Boolean\")\nis always a bad design decesion. This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that\nthe Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.\n\n## The Math\n\nOn the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that \nthe Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in\nnumber theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think\nthat proving that if a is divisible by b, then b < a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,\nwe go **FULL RIGOR**, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal\ninference or hand waving (the student's response: \"full rigor leads to rigor mortis\"). All the problem\nsets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers. \n\n## The Counsellors\nAll the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say \"I have a math problem\" and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are\ngraded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person \"family\" with a consellor creates a sense\nof camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.\n\n\n## Lectures\nSpecial lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/). These are\nvery exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms\nto computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson's Pigeonhole lecture series in\nthe first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened\nmy conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar's talk on the [hyper-reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)\n\n## The Community\nThe community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it\nis quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math. \nWe all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel\nthat the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that **it prepares you for how life will be in\nuniversity**. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people\nin a similar major to discuss your shared passion. \n\n## The Food\nI'd rather not dwell on this subject for too long.\n\n\n## Tips\nIf you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.\n- learn how to use a washing machine before you go\n- bring some emergency food with you\n- **pro tip:** bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring \na sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.\n- In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over\nwho say up very late and you don't want to be kept awake\n- The Ross website may claim that you shouldn't bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but \nyou will probably be fine if you bring these things.\n\n\n## Should you go to Ross?\nIf you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply \nto the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math\nbefore, but I really liked the experience.
