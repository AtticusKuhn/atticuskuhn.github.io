Decidability\nbasically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. [Adding Numbers](https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary) is decidable but [finding the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in\nall systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more\nrules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?\nI will start with a few examples\n\n# Typing Systems for Programming Languages\n\nI first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically\nan algorithm that says `5` is an integer or `[1,2,3]` is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by [Algorithm W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W). A type system is very useful,\nbut people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they\ntry to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of \n[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)'s [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), you might realise that the type of the second\nargument depends on the type of the first argument.\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%f %s\", 1.2, \"hello\")\n```\nIf you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered\ndependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently\ntyped program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)). One you say you want this, you have stepped out\nof the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler\nusing a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A good documentation of this problem is on the website [typing is hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html).\n\nIn my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don't want\nto have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.\n\n# Presbuger Arithmetic\n\nAnother beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is [Presburger Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic). Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic\nwhere every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say \n`x+y > 10` and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?\nThere is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.\nSo statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And\nOnce we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.\n\n# Undecidability is Interesting\n\nUnlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do **not**\nwant decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no\ninteresting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between\nexpressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose\ninteresting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,\ntruth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is \ntrue, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses\nall its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn't so bad.\n\n# Walking off the Cliff\n\nWhat can you take away from this? Well let's say you're designing a programming tool like\na configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,\nunwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,\nwhere now they are [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete) (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to\nkeep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that\nmight cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability. \n\n\n","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["automata"," decidability"," presbuger arithmetic"," type system"],"title":"The Decidability Tradeoff","slug":"decidability-tradeoff","description":"There is a fine line between power and decidability","image":"/images/automata.jpeg"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\n\nThe text editor VIM is possibly one of my favourite tools for developing and coding.

Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again. There is something immensely satisfying about executing the proper algorithm in VIM which I strive for every time I code. \n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["vim"],"title":"Why I love VIM","slug":"why-i-love-vim","description":"Vim is arguable the best text editor","image":"/images/vim.png"},{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad. Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"},{"content":"\n\nComplex analysis might just be my favorite field of mathematics.
