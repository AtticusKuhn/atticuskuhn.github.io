I would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that
the Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Math</h1>
<p>On the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that
the Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in
number theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think
that proving that if a is divisible by b, then b &lt; a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,
we go <strong>FULL RIGOR</strong>, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal
inference or hand waving (the student&#x27;s response: &quot;full rigor leads to rigor mortis&quot;). All the problem
sets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Counsellors</h1>
<p>All the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say &quot;I have a math problem&quot; and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are
graded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person &quot;family&quot; with a consellor creates a sense
of camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Lectures</h1>
<p>Special lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">OSU</a>. These are
very exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms
to computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson&#x27;s Pigeonhole lecture series in
the first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened
my conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar&#x27;s talk on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">hyper-reals</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Community</h1>
<p>The community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it
is quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math.
We all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel
that the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that <strong>it prepares you for how life will be in
university</strong>. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people
in a similar major to discuss your shared passion.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Food</h1>
<p>I&#x27;d rather not dwell on this subject for too long.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Tips</h1>
<p>If you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">learn how to use a washing machine before you go</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">bring some emergency food with you</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal"><strong>pro tip:</strong> bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring
a sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over
who say up very late and you don&#x27;t want to be kept awake</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">The Ross website may claim that you shouldn&#x27;t bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but
you will probably be fine if you bring these things.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Should you go to Ross?</h1>
<p>If you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply
to the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math
before, but I really liked the experience.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/promise-is-a-monad"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why promise IS a monad" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/monad.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Why promise IS a monad</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">There are monads all around us, even if we don&#x27;t notice it</div></div></a><a href="/blog/rss"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why RSS Feeds are the Superior way to Stay Up-to-Date" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/rss.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Why RSS Feeds are the Superior way to Stay Up-to-Date</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I just started using an RSS feed</div></div></a><a href="/blog/linux"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="My experience using Linux" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/nixos.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">My experience using Linux</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I recently switched to using only Linux.

Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) =\u003e t (m a) -\u003e m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -\u003e promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs \u003e\u003e=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (\u003e\u003e=) :: Monad m =\u003e m a -\u003e (a -\u003e m b) -\u003e m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=\u003e data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator \u003e\u003e= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that \u003e\u003e= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (\u003e\u003e=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"},{"content":"\n\n\n# What is an RSS Feed\n\nRSS is a standard by which you may subscribe to the content of other websites, and recieve updates about the news on other websites in a \nstandardized way so that many programs can read and understand the infromation. RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.
