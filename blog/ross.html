I would like to give a review. I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that
the Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Math</h1>
<p>On the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that
the Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in
number theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think
that proving that if a is divisible by b, then b &lt; a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,
we go <strong>FULL RIGOR</strong>, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal
inference or hand waving (the student&#x27;s response: &quot;full rigor leads to rigor mortis&quot;). All the problem
sets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Counsellors</h1>
<p>All the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say &quot;I have a math problem&quot; and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are
graded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person &quot;family&quot; with a consellor creates a sense
of camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Lectures</h1>
<p>Special lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">OSU</a>. These are
very exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms
to computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson&#x27;s Pigeonhole lecture series in
the first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened
my conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar&#x27;s talk on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">hyper-reals</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Community</h1>
<p>The community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it
is quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math.
We all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel
that the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that <strong>it prepares you for how life will be in
university</strong>. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people
in a similar major to discuss your shared passion.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">The Food</h1>
<p>I&#x27;d rather not dwell on this subject for too long.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Tips</h1>
<p>If you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">learn how to use a washing machine before you go</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">bring some emergency food with you</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal"><strong>pro tip:</strong> bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring
a sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over
who say up very late and you don&#x27;t want to be kept awake</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">The Ross website may claim that you shouldn&#x27;t bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but
you will probably be fine if you bring these things.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Should you go to Ross?</h1>
<p>If you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply
to the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math
before, but I really liked the experience.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/fav-lang"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="My favourite Programming languages" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/php.png"/><div class="font-bold">My favourite Programming languages</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job</div></div></a><a href="/blog/create-personal-site"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Tips for Creating a Personal Site" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/personal-identity.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Tips for Creating a Personal Site</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">If you are thinking about creating a personal site, I have advice</div></div></a><a href="/blog/decidability-tradeoff"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="The Decidability Tradeoff" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/automata.jpeg"/><div class="font-bold">The Decidability Tradeoff</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">There is a fine line between power and decidability</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>Ⓒ all rights reserved <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2022</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nI just recently got back from attending the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/) in Ohio and\nI would like to give a review.

The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does.

Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating.

Decidability\nbasically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. [Adding Numbers](https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary) is decidable but [finding the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in\nall systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more\nrules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?\nI will start with a few examples\n\n# Typing Systems for Programming Languages\n\nI first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically\nan algorithm that says `5` is an integer or `[1,2,3]` is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by [Algorithm W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W). A type system is very useful,\nbut people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they\ntry to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of \n[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)'s [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), you might realise that the type of the second\nargument depends on the type of the first argument.\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%f %s\", 1.2, \"hello\")\n```\nIf you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered\ndependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently\ntyped program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)). One you say you want this, you have stepped out\nof the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler\nusing a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A good documentation of this problem is on the website [typing is hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html).\n\nIn my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don't want\nto have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.\n\n# Presbuger Arithmetic\n\nAnother beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is [Presburger Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic). Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic\nwhere every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say \n`x+y \u003e 10` and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?\nThere is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.\nSo statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And\nOnce we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.\n\n# Undecidability is Interesting\n\nUnlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do **not**\nwant decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no\ninteresting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between\nexpressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose\ninteresting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,\ntruth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is \ntrue, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses\nall its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn't so bad.\n\n# Walking off the Cliff\n\nWhat can you take away from this? Well let's say you're designing a programming tool like\na configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,\nunwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,\nwhere now they are [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete) (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to\nkeep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that\nmight cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability. \n\n\n","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["automata"," decidability"," presbuger arithmetic"," type system"],"title":"The Decidability Tradeoff","slug":"decidability-tradeoff","description":"There is a fine line between power and decidability","image":"/images/automata.jpeg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ross"},"buildId":"Xozn3mTXFO_3WIwREEH5h","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
