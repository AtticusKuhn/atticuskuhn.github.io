Decidability\nbasically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. [Adding Numbers](https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary) is decidable but [finding the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in\nall systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more\nrules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?\nI will start with a few examples\n\n# Typing Systems for Programming Languages\n\nI first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically\nan algorithm that says `5` is an integer or `[1,2,3]` is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by [Algorithm W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W). A type system is very useful,\nbut people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they\ntry to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of \n[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)'s [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), you might realise that the type of the second\nargument depends on the type of the first argument.\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%f %s\", 1.2, \"hello\")\n```\nIf you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered\ndependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently\ntyped program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)). One you say you want this, you have stepped out\nof the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler\nusing a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A good documentation of this problem is on the website [typing is hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html).\n\nIn my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don't want\nto have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.\n\n# Presbuger Arithmetic\n\nAnother beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is [Presburger Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic). Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic\nwhere every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say \n`x+y \u003e 10` and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?\nThere is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.\nSo statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And\nOnce we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.\n\n# Undecidability is Interesting\n\nUnlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do **not**\nwant decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no\ninteresting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between\nexpressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose\ninteresting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,\ntruth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is \ntrue, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses\nall its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn't so bad.\n\n# Walking off the Cliff\n\nWhat can you take away from this? Well let's say you're designing a programming tool like\na configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,\nunwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,\nwhere now they are [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete) (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to\nkeep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that\nmight cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability. \n\n\n","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["automata"," decidability"," presbuger arithmetic"," type system"],"title":"The Decidability Tradeoff","slug":"decidability-tradeoff","description":"There is a fine line between power and decidability","image":"/images/automata.jpeg"},{"content":"\nI have written this blog post to commemorate how my site has started today.
