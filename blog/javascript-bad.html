Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.
Why is Javascript perceived as bad?
To see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of
weak typing</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">general weirdness</h1>
<p>I find many of the criticisms of javascript are &quot;why doesn&#x27;t this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot&quot;. These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript.
The History of Javascript
Looking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Opinionated vs Flexible</h1>
<p>The core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let&#x27;s say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it&#x27;s better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/fav-lang"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="My favourite Programming languages" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/php.png"/><div class="font-bold">My favourite Programming languages</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job</div></div></a><a href="/blog/create-personal-site"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Tips for Creating a Personal Site" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/personal-identity.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Tips for Creating a Personal Site</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">If you are thinking about creating a personal site, I have advice</div></div></a><a href="/blog/why-i-love-vim"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Why I love VIM" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/vim.png"/><div class="font-bold">Why I love VIM</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Vim is arguable the best text editor</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>â’¸ all rights reserved <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad.

If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\n# My Site\nAs I have created a personal site (you're looking at it right now), I feel somewhat\nqualified to give advice to others on the best way of creating a personal site. Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of\ncontent has a two-fold benefit\n\n* As you write more, you will become better at writing\n\n* By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on\nyour site.\n\nHonestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites. \nOf course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),\nyet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing\nlong articles\n\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI hope I have given some unconventional advice on how to start a personal site.

Whenever I have the opportunity to use vim, from VS code to Overleaf, and even google docs, I take it. I just want more people to learn and use VIM because of what an enjoyable tool is\n\n# Macros\nMany people often waste time slaving away at menial and boring text editing tasks. Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again.
