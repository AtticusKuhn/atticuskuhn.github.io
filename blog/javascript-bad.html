Why is Javascript perceived as bad?
To see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of

<p>I find many of the criticisms of javascript are &quot;why doesn&#x27;t this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot&quot;. These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript.
The History of Javascript
Looking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-5xl font-bold p-1">Opinionated vs Flexible</h1>
<p>The core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let&#x27;s say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it&#x27;s better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled.</p></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="fl"><a href="/blog/complex-analysis"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img class="p-sm mx-auto m-0 block sm:h-7/12 sm:w-7/12 h-full w-full" src="/images/complex-analysis.png"/><div class="font-bold">Complex Analysis is Super Cool</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">it&#x27;s my favorite field of mathematics</div></div></a><a href="/blog/promise-is-a-monad"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img class="p-sm mx-auto m-0 block sm:h-7/12 sm:w-7/12 h-full w-full" src="/images/monad.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Why promise IS a monad</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">There are monads all around us, even if we don&#x27;t notice it</div></div></a><a href="/blog/why-i-love-vim"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img class="p-sm mx-auto m-0 block sm:h-7/12 sm:w-7/12 h-full w-full" src="/images/vim.png"/><div class="font-bold">Why I love VIM</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Vim is arguable the best text editor</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span>â’¸ all rights reserved Atticus Kuhn <!-- -->2022</span></footer></div></div><script src="/_next/static/chunks/react-refresh.js"></script><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad.

Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) =\u003e t (m a) -\u003e m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -\u003e promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs \u003e\u003e=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (\u003e\u003e=) :: Monad m =\u003e m a -\u003e (a -\u003e m b) -\u003e m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=\u003e data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator \u003e\u003e= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that \u003e\u003e= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (\u003e\u003e=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"},{"content":"\n\nThe text editor VIM is possibly one of my favourite tools for developing and coding.

I just want more people to learn and use VIM because of what an enjoyable tool is\n\n# Macros\nMany people often waste time slaving away at menial and boring text editing tasks. Vim makes relative tasks and actions easy using macros, or repeatable sets of keystrokes. \n\n\n# Speed\nIt's no doubt that with all the keybindings, getting from one location in the text to another is usually only a few keypresses. Typing is far faster than using a mouse. I have no doubt that my coding speed has increased twofold due to Vim.\n\n\n# Efficiency\nOften when I realise I have not completed the most keystroke efficient algorithm in VIM, I undo all my changes to try again.
