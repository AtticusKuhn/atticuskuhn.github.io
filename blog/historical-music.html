<p>In this blog post, I am going to analyze the music of several countries from history that I personally
find interesting. I have been interested in history for a long time, and if you are also interested
in history, then I think that music is uniquely positioned to gain an understanding of the past.
Humans have been creating music for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tfBLvlN98" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">at least 3500 years</a>,
and probably longer, so there seems to be something intrisic to humans about creating music.
Furthermore, since most songs are short (on the order of 5 minutes), we must distill our soul
and essence into a simple and memorable phrase in order to be musical. This desire creates brevity,
which can easily help us gain the gist of a historical society. This need is amplified
by folk music, which is designed to be easily sung by large groups of people, so is often
melodically and lyrically simple (simple does not necessarily mean bad). These are the
historical societies I will analyze through the lens of music</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Soviet Union / Russia</h1>
<p>The first song we will look at is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAoibAgAvM" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Swallowing Dust</a>.
Below I have posted the lyrics:</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Russian</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Да один, я остался один</td><td>yes, I was alone</td></tr><tr><td>а все друзья мои полегли,</td><td>and all my friends perished,</td></tr><tr><td>Вся надежда – один магазин</td><td>all hope is on one magazine</td></tr><tr><td>просто так не возьмёте, скоты!</td><td>But you won&#x27;t take me that easy, brutes!</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>We can see that the Russians fight till the end with resourcefullness (&quot;But you won&#x27;t take me that easy&quot;). I think this is in keeping with Russian character. Looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Russian History</a>, it is certainly brutal. This song portrays Russian
stoicism and bravery in the face of hardships, but another song shows the other face of
the coin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHCzaiJEoEY" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Don&#x27;t Tell Mom I&#x27;m In Chechnya</a>
is a more depressing song about a soldier lamenting and cursing the horrors of the
Chechnyan War.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Russian</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>С другом Саней что он вернется держу пари</td><td>I made a bet with my friend Sanya, that he will return</td></tr><tr><td>Ты только маме что я в Чечне не говори.</td><td>Just don&#x27;t tell mom that I&#x27;m in Chechnya.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The dark truth is that if the singer made a bet against Sanya that he will come back, that
implies that Sanya bet he would die. In the hard history of Russia, I imagine that a
bit of morbid humour would be necessary to survive and make sense of it.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Germany</h1>
<p>The next culture we will look at the songs of is Germany. One especially moving song is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1Z1y2PSNw" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Ich Hatt&#x27; Einen Kameraden</a>.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>German</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Er liegt vor meinen Füßen</td><td>Now he lies here at my feet</td></tr><tr><td>Als wär&#x27;s ein Stück von mir</td><td>As if he were part of me</td></tr><tr><td>Will mir die Hand noch reichen,</td><td>Yet he reached out his hand to me,</td></tr><tr><td>Kann dir die Hand nicht geben</td><td>I cannot take your hand, right now</td></tr><tr><td>Bleib du im ew&#x27;gen Leben</td><td>May you rest there, in eternal life</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Prussia has sometimes been described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army#:~:text=The%20social%20classes%20were%20all,an%20army%20with%20a%20country%22." node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">not a country with an army, but an army with a country</a>. This lead to many great military victories for Prussia, but
also immense loss for the soldiers on the battlefield. The line that particularly stands
out is &quot;As if he were part of me&quot;, because it depicts the tight bond that forms between
soldiers on the battlfield. The singer and his comrade are so close that theey feel
physically attached.</p>
<p>On a more uplifiting note, the next song we will look at is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UBQArOa5c" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Palästinalied</a>, a song based on a poem from the 13th century.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>German</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nû lebe ich mir alrêrst werde,</td><td>Now I live only worthy</td></tr><tr><td>sît mîn sündic ouge sihet</td><td>Since my sinful eye sees</td></tr><tr><td>daz hêre lant und ouch die erde,</td><td>The pure land and also the earth</td></tr><tr><td>der man vil der êren gihet.</td><td>which is worshipped so much</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>You can almost hear the wonder coming from this song. I like to imagine a knight who has
heard so much about Jerusalem finally arriving and praising what he sees. Even though, this
song still remains a tone solumn and humble (&quot;sinful eye sees&quot;). It&#x27;s almost like
the author is humbled by being in such a special place.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">France</h1>
<p>Now onto a nation bording Germany, which is France. I have recently taken a liking
to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MFBD15ehjA" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Vive Henri IV</a></p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>French</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Au diable guerres,</td><td>To hell with wars,</td></tr><tr><td>Rancunes et partis !</td><td>Grudges and partisanship!</td></tr><tr><td>Comme nos pères</td><td>Like our fathers</td></tr><tr><td>Chantons en vrais amis,</td><td>Let us sing as true friends,</td></tr><tr><td>Au choc des verres,</td><td>Clink the glasses,</td></tr><tr><td>Les roses et les lys.</td><td>The roses and the lilies.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Aside from having a really spritely melody, the lyrics also have a fun and playful nature.
It has a message of celebration, not only of the honourable monarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Henry IV</a>, but also of the festivites. I reccomend singing this song
at your next party.</p>
<p>We will next study <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Seigneurs, Sachiez</a>, which
was amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing
such a good song?</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>French</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça</td><td>All the bad people will stay behind</td></tr><tr><td>qui n&#x27;aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.</td><td>those who don&#x27;t love God, honor, or pray to Him</td></tr><tr><td>Et chascuns dit: &quot;Ma feme, que fera?</td><td>And some say &quot;what will my wife do?</td></tr><tr><td>Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!&quot;</td><td>I will not leave without my friends&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,</td><td>These men have fallen into foolish concerns</td></tr><tr><td>qu&#x27;il n&#x27;est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,</td><td>For man has no friends except</td></tr><tr><td>qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.</td><td>He who was put on the true cross for our sake</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.
As a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far
away and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his
message. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading (&quot;what will my
wife do?&quot;), and then explains why these concerns are not valid.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Britain</h1>
<p>Britain is a country close to my heart, and it also has some very good songs.
The first song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU123EhCjBA" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">My England</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-xl font-bold p-1">My England</h1>
<p>Born and raised in a laying land<br/>
<!-- -->The guardian of the islands<br/>
<!-- -->Where the rolling hills and the mountain streams<br/>
<!-- -->meet the sweet sweet peace of the highlands<br/>
<!-- -->Oh how I love my motherland, this blessed land of freedom<br/>
<!-- -->Where every heart that shares her peace, feels the glory of her Eden<br/>
<!-- -->And she lifts up my soul like a bright sunny day<br/>
<!-- -->and she stays in my life like a song</p>
<p>These expressive lyrics capture the beauty of the English countryside. I can almost imagine <br/>
<!-- -->the green pastures of Yorkshire when I listen to this song.</p>
<p>And I would be remissed not to mention the most famous British historical song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrxHO-B2TY" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">The British
Grenadiers</a></p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-xl font-bold p-1">The British Grenadiers</h1>
<p>Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules<br/>
<!-- -->Of Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.<br/>
<!-- -->But of all the world&#x27;s brave heroes, there&#x27;s none that can compare.<br/>
<!-- -->With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.</p>
<p>I do like the sophisticated swagger and bravado of this song. It&#x27;s has the confident tone
of dismissing these heros of antiquity. From the first bars, we can tell from this self-confidence
that this is going to be a fun and uplifting song.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Yugoslavia</h1>
<p>There is a very good video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">&quot;My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music&quot;</a> that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason
why Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,
where 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages
are all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.
They accomplished this through music. First, we will look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">My Dad is a War Criminal!
</a>.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Serbian</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Moj je tata zločinac iz rata</td><td>My dad is a war criminal</td></tr><tr><td>Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite</td><td>You can try condemning him</td></tr><tr><td>Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda</td><td>But no one has the balls to arrest him</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Apparantly this song is satire of the UN, who called Serbia war criminals. Honestly,
it&#x27;s a really funny song because it contains an unsual topic. I don&#x27;t know any other
songs where the singer just openly admits war crimes.
The next song we will look at is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333OVHhpK5c" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Crni Bombarderi</a>.
It&#x27;s by Roki Vulovic, who has many other great songs you should also check out.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Serbian</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Da li je to istina ili se samo šališ</td><td>Is it the truth or are you just joking ?</td></tr><tr><td>Na Balkanu hoćeš vatru da zapališ</td><td>You want to start a fire on the balkans</td></tr><tr><td>Prijatelju stari iz prošloga rata</td><td>Old friend from the previous war</td></tr><tr><td>Stavićeš i sebi omcu oko vrata</td><td>You&#x27;ll put the rope around your own neck</td></tr><tr><td>Sa Srbima ne smije inat da se tera</td><td>Don&#x27;t pick a fight with the defiant serbs</td></tr><tr><td>Izgubićeš jato crnih bombardera</td><td>You&#x27;ll lose your swarm of black bombers</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This song refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">1999 F-117A shootdown</a>
incident. The US had the most advanced stealth technology in the world, and said
their bomber was invisible. The Serbs had obselete Soviet missile technology,
yet still managed to shoot down the plane.  They said <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_poster_%22Sorry_we_didn%27t_know_it_was_invisible%22.jpg" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">&quot;Sorry we didn&#x27;t know it was invisible&quot;</a>.
I think that&#x27;s a pretty amazing story, and the story is reflected in the lyrics of the song.</p>

I reccomend singing this song\nat your next party.\n\nWe will next study [Seigneurs, Sachiez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s), which\nwas amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing\nsuch a good song? \n\n|French|English|\n|------|-------|\n|Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça| All the bad people will stay behind|\n|qui n'aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.| those who don't love God, honor, or pray to Him|\n|Et chascuns dit: \"Ma feme, que fera?| And some say \"what will my wife do?|\n|Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!\"| I will not leave without my friends\"|\n|Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,|These men have fallen into foolish concerns|\n|qu'il n'est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,| For man has no friends except|\n|qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.| He who was put on the true cross for our sake|\n\nI imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.\nAs a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far\naway and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his\nmessage. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading (\"what will my \nwife do?\"), and then explains why these concerns are not valid. \n\n# Britain\nBritain is a country close to my heart, and it also has some very good songs.\nThe first song is [My England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU123EhCjBA)\n\n### My England\nBorn and raised in a laying land  \nThe guardian of the islands  \nWhere the rolling hills and the mountain streams  \nmeet the sweet sweet peace of the highlands  \nOh how I love my motherland, this blessed land of freedom  \nWhere every heart that shares her peace, feels the glory of her Eden  \nAnd she lifts up my soul like a bright sunny day  \nand she stays in my life like a song  \n\nThese expressive lyrics capture the beauty of the English countryside. I can almost imagine \\\nthe green pastures of Yorkshire when I listen to this song.\n\nAnd I would be remissed not to mention the most famous British historical song: [The British\nGrenadiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrxHO-B2TY)\n\n### The British Grenadiers\nSome talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules  \nOf Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.  \nBut of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare.  \nWith a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.  \n\nI do like the sophisticated swagger and bravado of this song. It's has the confident tone\nof dismissing these heros of antiquity. From the first bars, we can tell from this self-confidence\nthat this is going to be a fun and uplifting song. \n\n# Yugoslavia\nThere is a very good video [\"My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg) that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason\nwhy Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,\nwhere 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages\nare all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.\nThey accomplished this through music. First, we will look at [My Dad is a War Criminal!\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8).\n\n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Moj je tata zločinac iz rata|My dad is a war criminal \n|Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite|You can try condemning him|\n|Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda |But no one has the balls to arrest him |\n\nApparantly this song is satire of the UN, who called Serbia war criminals. Honestly,\nit's a really funny song because it contains an unsual topic. I don't know any other\nsongs where the singer just openly admits war crimes. \nThe next song we will look at is [Crni Bombarderi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333OVHhpK5c).\nIt's by Roki Vulovic, who has many other great songs you should also check out. \n|Serbian|English|\n|-------|-------|\n|Da li je to istina ili se samo šališ|Is it the truth or are you just joking ?|\n|Na Balkanu hoćeš vatru da zapališ|You want to start a fire on the balkans| \n|Prijatelju stari iz prošloga rata|Old friend from the previous war|\n|Stavićeš i sebi omcu oko vrata|You'll put the rope around your own neck|\n|Sa Srbima ne smije inat da se tera|Don't pick a fight with the defiant serbs|\n|Izgubićeš jato crnih bombardera|You'll lose your swarm of black bombers|\n\nThis song refers to the [1999 F-117A shootdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown)\nincident. The US had the most advanced stealth technology in the world, and said\ntheir bomber was invisible. The Serbs had obselete Soviet missile technology,\nyet still managed to shoot down the plane.  They said [\"Sorry we didn't know it was invisible\"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_poster_%22Sorry_we_didn%27t_know_it_was_invisible%22.jpg).\nI think that's a pretty amazing story, and the story is reflected in the lyrics of the song.\n\n# Conclusion\nI am trying to expand my collection of historical music. If you have any historical\nsongs that you want me to add to this blog or that you want me to know about,\nplease [contact me](/contact).\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n","date":"April 11, 2022","tags":["History"," Music"],"title":"What Can We Learn from Historical Music?","slug":"historical-music","description":"We can glean a lot from music.","image":"/images/Theobald_I.jpg"},"reccomendedBlog":[{"content":"\n\nWith so many different programming languages and technologies available today, it can sometimes be confusing on which to choose for a new project. If I were given the choice, these are my top 4 favourite languages that I would use. \n\n\n\n# 4 Python\nI really like the syntax of python. The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language. It is type-safe and entirely functional. By learning Haskell, I have changed the way I think about programming. Haskell forces the programmer to learn about types and side effects in a way which no other language does. I will always try to use Haskell if I can in any context.\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["python"," PHP"," javascript"," go"," java"," haskell"],"title":"My favourite Programming languages","slug":"fav-lang","description":"Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job","image":"/images/php.png"},{"content":"\n\n\n# Boolean Considered Harmful\n\nI make the claim that using the boolean type (called \"Boolean\")\nis always a bad design decesion. This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"},{"content":"\n\nMany people mock Javascript for being bad. Go on any programming forum and you will find countless jokes at the expense of Javascript, but I argue that many of the things people hate most about Javascript were necessary for it to survive.\nWhy is Javascript perceived as bad?\nTo see why this is the case let us first look at the most maligned aspects of Javascript. When I ask people why they hate Javascript, they will say something along the lines of \nweak typing\n\n\n# general weirdness\nI find many of the criticisms of javascript are \"why doesn't this language stop me from shooting myself in the foot\". These are certainly desirable traits, and they are certainly being remedied in modern times with strict mode in ES6 and typescript. \nThe History of Javascript \nLooking at the history of Javascript reveals why it must have been this way. It was invented by Brendan Eich in 10 days in 1995, when the web was nothing like it is today.  Just imagine how different the web is by looking at a website from 1995 and comparing it to any modern website. Eich, and indeed nobody, could have imagined how the web could have evolved, so planning for the web to change drastically was needed.\n\n# Opinionated vs Flexible\nThe core of my argument is that people want Javascript to be opinionated and strict, when, due to the complex and evolving nature of the web, it is necessary that javascript be flexible and weak. Let's say Javascript took a hard stand and became inflexible on an issue pertaining to the 90s. We today would find that anachronistic and annoying. No central authority can predict how a programming language can be used, so it's better to leave all tools available to the programmer instead of walling off some features for fear that they might be mishandled. \n","date":"May 26, 2021","tags":["javascript"," web"," web programming"],"title":"Javascript Being Bad is why it's Good","slug":"javascript-bad","description":"People malign javascript for all the wrong reasons","image":"/images/techs/javascript.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"historical-music"},"buildId":"0hLB6x2cRCNdtsKFdHMpt","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
