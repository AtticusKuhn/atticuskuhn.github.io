he says that we&#x27;ve &quot;basically discovered all the programming paradigms&quot;. He says this due to his
view that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.
My view is that <strong>a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model
of computation</strong>. I will explain what I mean.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Models of Computation</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Model of Computation</a> is
&quot;a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input&quot;.
There are a list of models of computation on the page, which include</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Post machines</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Pushdown automata</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Register machines</li>

<li index="15" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Petri nets</li>
<li index="16" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Synchronous Data Flow</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many models of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Minimal Addition</h1>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;minimal additon&quot;. Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means
some abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold
standard for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Haskell</a>, with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such
as Haskell&#x27;s monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Examples of Well-Loved Languages</h1>
<p>I will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good
models of computation.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Model of Computation</th><th>Language</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Untyped Lambda Calculus</td><td>Lisp</td></tr><tr><td>Typed Lambda Calculus</td><td>Haskell</td></tr><tr><td>Predicate Logic</td><td>Prolog</td></tr><tr><td>Rewriting System</td><td>Wolfram</td></tr><tr><td>Actor Model</td><td>Smalltalk</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction Nets</td><td><a href="https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Kind2</a></td></tr><tr><td>Combinatory Logic</td><td>APL</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.
And what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">minimal wrapper</a> on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features
beyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference
between Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Actor Model</a>
but Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly
borrows concepts from other languages.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Turing Completeness</h1>
<p>Due to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.
So, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model
that is the best for our needs.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Good Models of Computation</h1>
<p>Given all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?
I think it comes down to 2 critera:</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">being simple</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">having nice properties</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">SK Calculus</a> is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model
of computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of
a model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain.</p>
<p>For the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and
fast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Interaction Nets</a> because they have these properties</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">strong confluence</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing
an implementation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Advice to Aspiring Language Designers</h1>
<p>If you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to
choose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would
not design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected
by Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because
Prolog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can
be executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right
now I think the field of Linear Logic doesn&#x27;t have its own industry-strength programming
language. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.</p>

I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that\nthe Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.\n\n## The Math\n\nOn the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that \nthe Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in\nnumber theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think\nthat proving that if a is divisible by b, then b \u003c a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,\nwe go **FULL RIGOR**, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal\ninference or hand waving (the student's response: \"full rigor leads to rigor mortis\"). All the problem\nsets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers. \n\n## The Counsellors\nAll the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say \"I have a math problem\" and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are\ngraded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person \"family\" with a consellor creates a sense\nof camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.\n\n\n## Lectures\nSpecial lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/). These are\nvery exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms\nto computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson's Pigeonhole lecture series in\nthe first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened\nmy conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar's talk on the [hyper-reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)\n\n## The Community\nThe community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it\nis quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math. \nWe all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel\nthat the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that **it prepares you for how life will be in\nuniversity**. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people\nin a similar major to discuss your shared passion. \n\n## The Food\nI'd rather not dwell on this subject for too long.\n\n\n## Tips\nIf you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.\n- learn how to use a washing machine before you go\n- bring some emergency food with you\n- **pro tip:** bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring \na sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.\n- In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over\nwho say up very late and you don't want to be kept awake\n- The Ross website may claim that you shouldn't bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but \nyou will probably be fine if you bring these things.\n\n\n## Should you go to Ross?\nIf you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply \nto the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math\nbefore, but I really liked the experience.

This is because `Boolean` is\nlike the rind of an orange that has been squeezed out. The rind\ntestifies that there once was an orange here, but the juicy goodness\nof the orange is long gone.\n\nIt is the same with `Boolean`. If you are using `Boolean`, there was\nonce a function which returned more information, but this helpful information\nwas thrown away when all the information was squashed down into only 2 states.\n\nMy recommendation is that for any time you are tempted to write \"Boolean\", consider\nwhat information the function is actually computing.\n\nTo illustrate my point more, I will code the equality function on natural numbers in\n[Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)). For any natural numbers `x` and `y`, `x == y` returns `true` if `x` is equal\nto `y` and false otherwise. I will then contrast this function against `x ==? y`, which I claim\nis a better function.\n\nDo not worry if you do not know [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)), because\nI will be explaining the code at every step.\n\n\n# Standard Library Functions\n\nFirst, I will defining some standard functions.\nThese functions are all in the [standard library of Agda](https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/),\nso this section is a learning exercise where I will be thouroughly explaining the purpose of all\nthe code.\n\n## Peano Numbers\n\nWe will represent natural numbers as [Peano Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which means\nthat every natural number is either `0` or `successor(n)` for some natural number `n`. In Agda, we would\nrepresent the natural numbers as this data type:\n\n```agda\ndata NaturalNumber : Set where\n  zero : NaturalNumber\n  successor : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber\nvariable\n  m n : NaturalNumber\n```\n## Booleans\n\nWe can then define the much-dreaded `Boolean`, which is either `true` or `false`.\n\n```agda\ndata Boolean : Set where\n  true : Boolean\n  false : Boolean\n```\n## Booleanean (Bad) Equality\n\nIn our first attempt to define equality on natural numbers, we use a `Boolean` to represent the result:\n`true` if the two numbers are equal and `false` if the two numbers are not equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==_\n_==_ : NaturalNumber → NaturalNumber → Boolean\nzero == zero = true\nsuccessor a == zero = false\nzero == successor b = false\nsuccessor a == successor b = a == b\n```\n\n## Propositional Equality\n\nTo begin to define our better equality, we first need a specification of equality.\nSome beginners are confused by propositional equality because propositional equality\ndoes not *compute* if two values are equal, but rather it gives the type of all *proofs*\nthat they are equal.\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _≡_\ndata _≡_  {A : Set o} :  A → A →  Set (lsuc o) where\n  reflexivity : {a : A} →  a ≡ a\n```\n\nSo, for example, `a ≡ b` is the type of all proofs that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n## Empty Type\n\nThe empty type is inhabited by no values. The empty type represents the false proposition, or the proposition\nwith no proofs.\n\n```agda\ndata empty : Set where\n```\n\n## Decidability\n\nWith these pieces, we can define `decidability`. A proposition\nis [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) if there exists an\nalgorithm for deciding if the proposition is inhabited.\nThe `decides A` type will either produce evidence that `A` is inhabited, or\nproduce evidence that `A` in uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndata decides (A : Set o) : Set o where\n  trueBecauseOf : A → decides A\n  falseBecauseOf : (A → empty) → decides A\n```\n\nA simple utility function which proves that `successor` is\nan [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function).\n\n```agda\nsuccessorInjective : successor m ≡ successor n → m ≡ n\nsuccessorInjective reflexivity = reflexivity\n```\n\nGiven the type `decides`, we can say what it means for a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation)\nto be decidable: for all its inputs, we can produce evidence of the type\nbeing inhabited or uninhabited.\n\n```agda\ndecidable2 : {A B : Set o} →  (A → B → Set ℓ) → Set (o ⊔ ℓ)\ndecidable2 {A = A} {B = B} f = (a : A) (b : B) → decides (f a b)\n```\n\n# The Improved Natural Number Equality\n\nWe will now define the improved equality function on natural numbers:\n\n```agda\ninfixr 5 _==?_\n_==?_ : decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)\nzero ==? zero = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\nzero ==? successor y = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? zero = falseBecauseOf λ ()\nsuccessor x ==? successor y with (x ==? y)\n... | trueBecauseOf reflexivity = trueBecauseOf reflexivity\n... | falseBecauseOf x≢y = falseBecauseOf  (λ z → x≢y (successorInjective z))\n```\n\n# Why the Deciding Verison is Better\n\nYou might be wondering: \"why is `x ==? y` better than `x == y`\". In short, it is because\n`x ==? y` has a specification, but `x == y` does not.\n\nWhat's more, for all inputs, `x ==? y` returns evidence that it is correct, whereas we have not even\nstated the correctness specification for `x == y`.\n\nYou should always assume that everything is wrong until you have a formal proof that it is correct.\n\nAny function with the type signature `decidable2 {A = NaturalNumber}  (_≡_)` *must* be correct. By\nusing a more expressive type, we have ensured correctness automatically.  Others have said\n[\"make illegal states unrepresentable\"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/)\nbut I say, \"make incorrect code unwritable\".\nWrite a specification so that the only option is for your code to be correct.\n\nWith the pedestrian `x == y`, it would be easy to write a function with the same type signature that,\nin fact, would be incorrect.\n\nThe main concern in software is proofs of correctness. Every other aspect of code (including performance)\nis secondary. To learn more about this, look at [this talk](https://github.com/conal/talk-2023-galilean-revolution).\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly advise that 90% of the use of `Boolean`s is incorrect, and could be\nreplaced by more informative types.\n","date":"August 23, 2023","tags":["boolean"," denotational design"," correctness"],"title":"Boolean Considered Harmful","slug":"boolHarmful","description":"Most uses of Boolean are wrong","image":"/images/babBools.png"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"create-language"},"buildId":"M6hL-0Zkatcu026a0NimP","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
