he says that we&#x27;ve &quot;basically discovered all the programming paradigms&quot;. He says this due to his
view that programming paradigms are just restrictions on what programmers can do, but I disagree.
My view is that <strong>a good programming language is the minimal amount needed to add to a model
of computation</strong>. I will explain what I mean.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Models of Computation</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Model of Computation</a> is
&quot;a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input&quot;.
There are a list of models of computation on the page, which include</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Post machines</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Pushdown automata</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Register machines</li>
<li index="3" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Random-access machines</li>
<li index="4" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Turing machines</li>

<li index="6" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Abstract rewriting systems</li>
<li index="7" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Combinatory logic</li>

<li index="9" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Lambda calculus</li>
<li index="10" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Actor model</li>
<li index="11" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Cellular automaton</li>

<li index="15" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Petri nets</li>
<li index="16" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">Synchronous Data Flow</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many models of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Minimal Addition</h1>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;minimal additon&quot;. Well, a model of computation only describes mathematical functions, which are pure. We would like our programs to be able to interact with the outside world. This means
some abilities must be added to a model of computation in order to allow interaction. The gold
standard for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Haskell</a>, with its monadic model of computation. In a good language, effects should be modelled using some kind of language construct, such
as Haskell&#x27;s monads, but I think the construct will vary for each model of computation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Examples of Well-Loved Languages</h1>
<p>I will show how the best-designed languages today are simply the minimal additions to already good
models of computation.</p>
<table node="[object Object]" class=""><thead><tr><th>Model of Computation</th><th>Language</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Untyped Lambda Calculus</td><td>Lisp</td></tr><tr><td>Typed Lambda Calculus</td><td>Haskell</td></tr><tr><td>Predicate Logic</td><td>Prolog</td></tr><tr><td>Rewriting System</td><td>Wolfram</td></tr><tr><td>Actor Model</td><td>Smalltalk</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction Nets</td><td><a href="https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Kind2</a></td></tr><tr><td>Combinatory Logic</td><td>APL</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hopefully you see that all the languages on the right column are widely admired for being well-designed.
And what unifies them all? They are all strictly based on a model of computation.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the example of Lisp. Lisp is the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29950782" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">minimal wrapper</a> on top of the untyped lambda calculus. It does not include any features
beyound unleashing the inherent power of the lambda calculus. This is the main difference
between Smalltalk and Java. Both are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Actor Model</a>
but Smalltalk sticks truthfully to its model of computation, while Java confusedly
borrows concepts from other languages.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Turing Completeness</h1>
<p>Due to Turing Completeness, we can say that all models of computation are equally expressive.
So, it remains to be decided what model we should use. I think we should first choose a model
that is the best for our needs.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Good Models of Computation</h1>
<p>Given all these models of computation, which should we chose as a basis for our languages?
I think it comes down to 2 critera:</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">being simple</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">having nice properties</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first point, I think the model should be very simple. I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">SK Calculus</a> is very good in this regard, and it might be the simplest model
of computation that I have ever seen. Turing Machines, although the most well-known example of
a model of computation, are actually very complex and hard to explain.</p>
<p>For the second point, I mean that the model has properties that make it easy to implement and
fast to run on our given hardware. One model that is very promising is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets#Properties" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Interaction Nets</a> because they have these properties</p>
<ul>
<li index="0" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">locality (only active pairs can be rewritten)</li>
<li index="1" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">linearity (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time)</li>
<li index="2" node="[object Object]" class="list-decimal">strong confluence</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties would make an implementation very fast, so I encourage you to try writing
an implementation.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-2xl font-bold p-1">Advice to Aspiring Language Designers</h1>
<p>If you want to design a language, I have some advice for how to do it. The first step is to
choose a model of computation that has not yet been well-explored. For example, I would
not design a language based on lambda calculus because that space has already been perfected
by Lisp and Haskell, and I would not design a langauge based on predicate logic because
Prolog already does a good job there. I would choose a model that has good properties (can
be executed quickly on hardware) and has not been explored by any other language. Right
now I think the field of Linear Logic doesn&#x27;t have its own industry-strength programming
language. If you think you can design such a language, I would encourage you on.</p>

While most have gravitated towards it since the hype of the late 2000s, Srinivasan claims he has been “interested in machine learning since the 1990s,” almost noachian in this quickly evolving field. Today, I sat down with Srinivasan in order to glean what insights he has after pioneering this industry for 30 years. \n\nI am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn. \n\nFinding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.\n\nDespite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients. \n\nThe main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge. \n\t\nDoctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning. I suggest to the reader to conduct a similar informational interview, in the hopes that one could learn about an intriguing field from a personality. \n\n\n \n","date":"Feb 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," interview"," coding"],"title":"Interview with Machine Learning Expert","slug":"sandeep-interview","description":"After his 30 years in the field, machine learning engineer Sandeep Srinivasan offers advice on how to tackle this complex career.","image":"/images/sandeep.jpg"},{"content":"\nBecause I program in haskell, I have a lot of experience with monads, and now I see monads wherever I go. Monads are truly everywhere. Many people have already interacted with monads without even realising it. In fact, Javascript's promise is a monad. Despite this, the first result on google search for \"is promise a monad\", is titled, \"no, promise is not a monad\". I see this blog post as a response to that article. In this post by Buzz De Cafe, the author claims that javascript's promise is not a monad because it does not follow the mathematical laws of monads. However, nobody in haskell actually uses moands in the mathematical sense. It doesn't really matter if Promise is a mathematical monad, what really matters is if it acts like a programming monad, which it does. For example, let's take the haskell function \n\n```haskell\n\nsequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) =\u003e t (m a) -\u003e m (t a)\n\n```\nWhen I saw this, I was struck by how similar it is to Javascript's\n\n```haskell\nPromise.all ::[promise a] -\u003e promise [a]\n```\nI have written the type signature of Javascript's Promise.all in haskell syntax to lay apparent how similar these two functions are. Also let us look at .then vs \u003e\u003e=\n\n\n```haskell,\n\n (\u003e\u003e=) :: Monad m =\u003e m a -\u003e (a -\u003e m b) -\u003e m b\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nfetch(url)\n\t.then(data=\u003e data.json())\n```\nBoth haskell's bind operator \u003e\u003e= and javascript .then extract the internal value of a monad. And let me remind the reader, that \u003e\u003e= is the minimal operator for the monad typeclass in haskell, so if promise were defined in haskell, all one would have to do is\n\n```haskell\ninstance Monad Promise where\n     (\u003e\u003e=) = (then)\n```\n\nIt is obvious that Promise has all the characteristics of a Monad, so when haskellers complain that it does not obey some mathematical law, those are just sprinklings on top of a monad that don't really affect its functionality.  \n\nSome people may knock Javascript for not being as intellectual or high level as Haskell, but in fact it has almost all of the same structures, just with not as mathematical names. The example of Javascript's Promise being a monad shows that it is truly a high level language. \n\n\n\n","date":"April 12, 2021","tags":["haskell"],"title":"Why promise IS a monad","slug":"promise-is-a-monad","description":"There are monads all around us, even if we don't notice it","image":"/images/monad.jpg"},{"content":"\n\n\n# What is an RSS Feed\n\nRSS is a standard by which you may subscribe to the content of other websites, and recieve updates about the news on other websites in a \nstandardized way so that many programs can read and understand the infromation. RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.
