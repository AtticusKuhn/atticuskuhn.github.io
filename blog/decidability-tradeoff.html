<p>Like Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system
will eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability. Decidability
basically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. <a href="https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Adding Numbers</a> is decidable but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">finding the shortest path</a> is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in
all systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more
rules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?
I will start with a few examples</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Typing Systems for Programming Languages</h1>
<p>I first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically
an algorithm that says <code>5</code> is an integer or <code>[1,2,3]</code> is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Algorithm W</a>. A type system is very useful,
but people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they
try to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">C</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">printf</a>, you might realise that the type of the second
argument depends on the type of the first argument.</p>
<pre><div style="color:black;background:#f5f2f0;text-shadow:0 1px white;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto"><code class="language-c" style="color:black;background:none;text-shadow:0 1px white;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;font-size:1em;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span class="token" style="color:#DD4A68">printf</span><span class="token" style="color:#999">(</span><span class="token" style="color:#690">&quot;%f %s&quot;</span><span class="token" style="color:#999">,</span><span> </span><span class="token" style="color:#905">1.2</span><span class="token" style="color:#999">,</span><span> </span><span class="token" style="color:#690">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="token" style="color:#999">)</span></code></div></pre>
<p>If you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered
dependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently
typed program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">halting problem</a>). One you say you want this, you have stepped out
of the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler
using a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Idris</a>. A good documentation of this problem is on the website <a href="https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">typing is hard</a>.</p>
<p>In my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don&#x27;t want
to have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Hindley-Milner</a> which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Presbuger Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Another beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Presburger Arithmetic</a>. Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic
where every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say
<code>x+y &gt; 10</code> and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?
There is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.
So statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And
Once we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Undecidability is Interesting</h1>
<p>Unlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do <strong>not</strong>
want decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no
interesting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between
expressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose
interesting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,
truth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is
true, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses
all its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn&#x27;t so bad.</p>
<h1 class="flex flex-col text-primary-900 text-3xl font-bold p-1">Walking off the Cliff</h1>
<p>What can you take away from this? Well let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re designing a programming tool like
a configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,
unwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,
where now they are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete" node="[object Object]" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">turing complete</a> (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to
keep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that
might cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability.</p></div></p><div><div class="text-lg font-bold"> Reccomended Articles</div><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4"><a href="/blog/complex-analysis"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Complex Analysis is Super Cool" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/complex-analysis.png"/><div class="font-bold">Complex Analysis is Super Cool</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">it&#x27;s my favorite field of mathematics</div></div></a><a href="/blog/fav-lang"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="My favourite Programming languages" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/php.png"/><div class="font-bold">My favourite Programming languages</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">Programming languages are like tools, so you need the right tool for the job</div></div></a><a href="/blog/machine-learning-overrated"><div class="p-sm m-base flex flex-col bg-primary-100 rounded m-lg pop max-w-xl min-h-full "><img alt="Machine Learning is overrated" class="p-tiny mx-auto m-0 block h-full w-full" src="/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"/><div class="font-bold">Machine Learning is overrated</div><div class="text-primary-300 text-xs">I don&#x27;t understand the hype around machine learning</div></div></a></div></div></div><footer><hr/><span><a href="/rss.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">RSS feed</a> |<a href="/atom.xml" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">atom feed</a> |<a href="/rss.json" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">JSON feed</a> | MIT License <a href="https://atticuskuhn.github.io" class="pop rounded bg-primary-300 p-1 m-1 hover:bg-primary-100">Atticus Kuhn</a> <!-- -->2023</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blog":{"content":"\n\n# What is Undecidability\n\nLike Icarus flying too close to the sun it seems that every mathematical system\nwill eventually be drawn towards the black hole of undecidability.

The fact that it is indentation based and I don't have to deal with brackets makes the code look nice.\n\n\n# 3  PHP\nPHP is the kind of language which gets things done. I have always been interested in web development, and since PHP focuses almost exclusively on web development, I use it sometimes.\n\n\n# 2  Javascript\nAbove PHP, javascript is truly the language of the web. It is the only language to write  a full-stack application because it works on the front end and the back end.  From React to Node.js, there are many libraries, tools, and frameworks for Javascript. The extraordinary tooling makes it possible to do anything in javascript, and one will never have to switch languages if one chooses it.\n\n\n# 1  Haskell\nHaskell is my all time favourite language.

From [alpha go](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), which beat world-champion go\nplayers, to [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the constant news buzz\nwould make one think we are around the corner from [AI Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But I claim today that most of AI is just hype, with no\nreal substance behind it. Of course time will tell the true use of AI. In fact, most\ntimes teams eagerly throw a [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) at\na problem, they are really looking for a symbolic manipulation tool like [prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\n\n# Black Boxes\n\nThe first drawback of machine learning is they are incomprehensible. If a machine learning model\nmakes a mistake, how will you figure out what went wrong? There is no real way of knowing. Sure,\nyou can look at the internal state of the model, but what does that really tell you?\nModels today are getting so large that it is impossible to hold a single one in your\nbrain. GPT-3 has [175 billion parameters](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai/#:~:text=The%20largest%20version%20GPT%2D3,and%203.2%20M%20batch%20size.\u0026text=Shown%20in%20the%20figure%20above,that%20it%20is%20quite%20larger.)\nparameters. What if it makes a mistake? Will some engineer have to go through all\n175 billion parameters just to find it? I think the true solution is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) software\nthat simply states rules or definitions. That code is easier to debug and understand for\nnew users. In essence, we can only look at machine learning as a black box.\n\n# Changing Requirements\n\nOften in software engineering, projects are subject to [changing requirements](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/help-the-requirements-keep-changing-and-i-cant-nail-them-down-part-2/).\nWhat happens when this is done to a machine learning model? In short, I don't\nsee how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on\na slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model\nevery time you want to make a change. Google even spoke about this issue in their\npaper [Machine Learning:\nThe High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf). In our ever-changing world, you must truly\nconsider if you want to use a technology that requires so much effort even to change\nits purpose slightly.\n\n# Declarative Programming: is it Nirvana?\n\nI am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language) or from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\nIn such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and\nthe language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand\nbecause it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand\nthe behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never\nheard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other\nprogramming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage. It will rethink the way\nthat you understand the purpose of computers, [so try it out](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).","date":"January 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," ml"," AI"],"title":"Machine Learning is overrated","slug":"machine-learning-overrated","description":"I don't understand the hype around machine learning","image":"/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"decidability-tradeoff"},"buildId":"M6hL-0Zkatcu026a0NimP","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
