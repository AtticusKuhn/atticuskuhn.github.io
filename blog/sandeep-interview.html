While most have gravitated towards it since the hype of the late 2000s, Srinivasan claims he has been “interested in machine learning since the 1990s,” almost noachian in this quickly evolving field. Today, I sat down with Srinivasan in order to glean what insights he has after pioneering this industry for 30 years.</p>
<p>I am struck by Srinivasan’s positive attitude. He himself concurs, saying its necessary to be “a lifelong learner” to succeed in this field. Even with his experience, he is “still taking courses” to learn new skills and improve himself. His optimism extends further, however. When describing how he first got into machine learning, Srinivasan said a professor was too embarrassed that no one signed up for his course in machine learning, so he paid Srinivasan $10 an hour to be the only attendant. Despite being happenstance, Srinivasan tells the story with a smile as if it is a good joke. He brings this sense of optimism to his work, summarizing that the “best part of [his] job” is to meet bright 20-year-olds who have a “beginner’s mindset” and are eager to learn.</p>
<p>Finding these bright 20-year-olds is becoming increasingly difficult for Srinivasan, unfortunately. In this white-hot field, he must muscle his way through the likes of “Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.” Due to this drive for talent, Srinivasan complains that “the hardest part” of his job is hiring for his small machine learning startup.</p>
<p>Despite his recruiting woes, Srinivasan claims he is not deterred about founding a small machine learning startup. He says the experience has been rewarding for him. When speaking on the advantages of founding a startup, he says he gets to “eat [his] own dog food,” in the sense that he is excited to try out all the products as a consumer that he is inventing. He emphasize that a founder must act as the first customer of a product, because if the founder doesn’t believe in the product, then neither will the clients.</p>
<p>The main area where Srinivasan eagerly gets to try out his new inventions is with his products aiming to “simplify machine learning.” He uses his own online dashboard to set up machine learning models in a few clicks, and soon he hopes others can do the same. His mission is to “democratize machine learning for multiple applications.”  In the future, Srinivasan imagines that doctors or other domain experts could create machine learning models without coding and without technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Doctors are not the only profession Srinivasan predicts machine learning will impact. He thinks that many “repetitive tasks” such as “data entry” for taxes will disappear. In addition, manual tasks, such as image labeling will be automated away by machine learning.</p>
<p>Overall, I am very impressed with Srinivasan’s accomplishments. He certainly has the air of someone well-informed on the industry, and he was able to use his knowledge to give me personal advice for the job market (“learn statistics”). Given how he effuses knowledge in every aspect of machine learning, I would not be surprised if his startup goes far. This experience was very informative for me, and I see myself possibly having a career in machine learning.

RSS uses XML in order to communicate in a way\nthat can be easily parsed by other tools and applications.\n\n# RSS increases freedom and independence\n\nMy main promotion of RSS is a philosophical and ideological reason: RSS feeds increse freedom, independence, and decentralization on the internet.\nToo often, the web has been centralized under the lock-and-key of a few gatekeepers (to name them: Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft).\nAt the click of their fingers, and for whatever whim, as arbitrary as they desire, your subscriptions would be deleted without\nany trace or recourse.\n\nRSS feeds put the responsability in the hands of small website owners and blogs: because the standard is so simple, anyone\ncan implement and use it without the approval of those lords of the internet.\n\n# How to Find RSS Feeds\n\nUnfortunately for my idealistic ambitions, it seems that it is rare to find RSS feeds for the websites and information that I want.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the devtools and search for \"rss\" or \"atom\" in the HTML.\n\n\n## Tools for RSS\n\nIf my techniques don't work, sometimes there are tools out there to help you get an rss feed from a website.\n\nOne example is [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn an email list into an\nRSS feed.\n\n\n\n# My RSS Config\n\nFor Edifying purposes, I will share my RSS configuration for others who want to take the first step into the world of RSS.\nI use a program called [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as an RSS reader.

I came back from the airport giddy with excitement, and I wish that\nthe Ross Program could go for another week to distract me from school.\n\n## The Math\n\nOn the Ross Website, it makes it seem like you will do nothing but math for 6 weeks, and I can say that \nthe Ross Program is exactly as advertised. You will get 6 weeks of mathematics. The main curriculum in\nnumber theory was very interesting, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the integers. You may think\nthat proving that if a is divisible by b, then b \u003c a might be a trivial task, but  at the Ross Program,\nwe go **FULL RIGOR**, meaning that every proposition must be directly from the axioms with minimal\ninference or hand waving (the student's response: \"full rigor leads to rigor mortis\"). All the problem\nsets have interesting problems that test your conceptions of numbers. \n\n## The Counsellors\nAll the counsellors at the Ross Program are excited to help you with math and discuss any math topic (Shoutout to Jon!). Just say \"I have a math problem\" and 10 heads will snap in your direction. Problem sets are\ngraded daily by the counsellors. Being in a 4-person \"family\" with a consellor creates a sense\nof camaraderie, which is good because I arrived at Ross not knowing anyone.\n\n\n## Lectures\nSpecial lectures are given by the counsellors and professors from [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/). These are\nvery exciting and you do not want to miss them. They cover eclectic topics ranging from modular forms\nto computation theory. I made the mistake of missing out on Vitaly Berglesson's Pigeonhole lecture series in\nthe first week and I regret that I did not go. The lectures introduce you to new subjects and really broadened\nmy conception of what I thought math encompassed. My favourite talk might have been Oscar's talk on the [hyper-reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)\n\n## The Community\nThe community was my favorite thing about Ross. It is one thing to solve interesting problems, but it\nis quite another to collaborate on problems with people who are just as obsessed with math. \nWe all sort of egged each other on to solve more problems and inspired each other. I feel\nthat the biggest advantage of the Ross Program is that **it prepares you for how life will be in\nuniversity**. I.E. in university, you will likely specialize in a subject and hang out with people\nin a similar major to discuss your shared passion. \n\n## The Food\nI'd rather not dwell on this subject for too long.\n\n\n## Tips\nIf you are going to the Ross Program, I have some tips for you.\n- learn how to use a washing machine before you go\n- bring some emergency food with you\n- **pro tip:** bring a sleeping bag because the dorm beds are unsatisfactory to say the least. If you bring \na sleeping bag, you will be able to sleep.\n- In a similar vein, bring ear-plugs, because there are some people in the next dorm over\nwho say up very late and you don't want to be kept awake\n- The Ross website may claim that you shouldn't bring phones/computers/board games/cards, but \nyou will probably be fine if you bring these things.\n\n\n## Should you go to Ross?\nIf you would like to do math for 10 hours a day, for 7 days a week, for 6 weeks straight, then apply \nto the Ross Program. I was a bit intimidated at first because I had never done that much math\nbefore, but I really liked the experience.

Of course,\nif you are not impressed by my personal site, feel free not to take my advice.\n\n\nSpecifically, I think I will not give the standard or obvious advice, but rather\nI will give the advice that some people need to hear, but would rather not.\n\n# Fast and Functional\n\nThis might be a personal gripe of mine, but I would caution against using website creators\nsuch as Wix or Wordpress. They just create bloat on a site that really doesn't need it.\nWhen I go to such sites, it takes forever to load because of all the javascript bundles and\ntrackers. Really, if you can be served by plain HTML, then use plain HTML. It will give\nyour users better performance and the site will load almost instantaneously. And this\nsame advice even goes for frameworks. Do you really need your technology stack\nturning into a 100 layer wedding cake just for a personal site? Many people use their\npersonal website as an excuse to try out the latest technology. I know elm/svelte/tailwind/\nwhatever might be hot right now, but sometimes the safest option is best.\n\n# Prioritze Ease-of-Use over Flashy Animations\n\nI see some portfolio websites that look like they were created as a challenge\nto use every single animation avaible in CSS. But really, all animations do is\nslow down the user. If I have to wait 300ms for this flashy animation to complete,\nthen I feel like my flow has been interrupted on this site. I want the technology\nto get in my way as little as possible. Sure, some people take animations\nas an opportunity to show off, but if you must, put the animation in a place\nwhere it doesn't interrupt the flow of the site. Also, keep the animations small\nand less that 200ms. That way, your users will not be foaming at the mouth in\nrage at this mound of useless animations.\n\n# Create Lots of Content\n\nThis advice might seem obvious, but I think it merits repeating. Creating a wealth of\ncontent has a two-fold benefit\n\n* As you write more, you will become better at writing\n\n* By writing more, you will appear higher in search engines as more people click on\nyour site.\n\nHonestly, this is why I think starting a blog is a good idea for most personal sites. \nOf course the market is over-saturated (anyone is capable of starting a blog),\nyet you can always distinguish yourself by putting in extra efforts such as writing\nlong articles\n\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI hope I have given some unconventional advice on how to start a personal site.
