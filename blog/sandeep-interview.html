From [alpha go](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), which beat world-champion go\nplayers, to [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the constant news buzz\nwould make one think we are around the corner from [AI Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But I claim today that most of AI is just hype, with no\nreal substance behind it. Of course time will tell the true use of AI. In fact, most\ntimes teams eagerly throw a [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) at\na problem, they are really looking for a symbolic manipulation tool like [prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\n\n# Black Boxes\n\nThe first drawback of machine learning is they are incomprehensible. If a machine learning model\nmakes a mistake, how will you figure out what went wrong? There is no real way of knowing. Sure,\nyou can look at the internal state of the model, but what does that really tell you?\nModels today are getting so large that it is impossible to hold a single one in your\nbrain. GPT-3 has [175 billion parameters](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai/#:~:text=The%20largest%20version%20GPT%2D3,and%203.2%20M%20batch%20size.\u0026text=Shown%20in%20the%20figure%20above,that%20it%20is%20quite%20larger.)\nparameters. What if it makes a mistake? Will some engineer have to go through all\n175 billion parameters just to find it? I think the true solution is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) software\nthat simply states rules or definitions. That code is easier to debug and understand for\nnew users. In essence, we can only look at machine learning as a black box.\n\n# Changing Requirements\n\nOften in software engineering, projects are subject to [changing requirements](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/help-the-requirements-keep-changing-and-i-cant-nail-them-down-part-2/).\nWhat happens when this is done to a machine learning model? In short, I don't\nsee how a machine learning model trained for one task can be fixed to work on\na slightly different task. It would require a whole new retraining of the model\nevery time you want to make a change. Google even spoke about this issue in their\npaper [Machine Learning:\nThe High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf). In our ever-changing world, you must truly\nconsider if you want to use a technology that requires so much effort even to change\nits purpose slightly.\n\n# Declarative Programming: is it Nirvana?\n\nI am a huge fan of declarative programming, whether from the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language) or from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog).\nIn such a style, the programmer simply states the rules of the system formally, and\nthe language takes care of implementation concerns. This approach is easy to understand\nbecause it is just the rules of the system. In addition, it is easy to understand\nthe behavoir of a program: just follow which rules it applied.  If you have never\nheard of prolog, I strongly encourage you to check it out. It is unlike any other\nprogramming language, not part of the C or ALGOL lineage. It will rethink the way\nthat you understand the purpose of computers, [so try it out](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).","date":"January 27, 2022","tags":["machine learning"," ml"," AI"],"title":"Machine Learning is overrated","slug":"machine-learning-overrated","description":"I don't understand the hype around machine learning","image":"/images/Blog-Images-Forget-Machine-Learning-Humans-Still-Have-a-Lot-to-Learn-Part-II.jpg"},{"content":"\n\nSince haskell is a list-based language, there are many ways to work with lists.

Decidability\nbasically means there is an algorithm to answer a question. [Adding Numbers](https://lisbdnet.com/what-is-standard-algorithm-addition/#:~:text=standard%20algorithm%20addition%3F-,The%20standard%20algorithm%20for%20addition%20has%20three%20simple%20rules%3A,3%3A%20Regroup%2C%20if%20necessary) is decidable but [finding the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is not. In general I have noticed a pattern in\nall systems of rules. The system starts off simple. Then, as more use cases pile up, more\nrules and properties are added until suddenly, the system is undecidable. What happend here?\nI will start with a few examples\n\n# Typing Systems for Programming Languages\n\nI first encountered this problem in the type system of programming languages, or basically\nan algorithm that says `5` is an integer or `[1,2,3]` is a list of integers. You may think this problem is easy, and indeed the way I have just phrased it is decidable by [Algorithm W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_W). A type system is very useful,\nbut people have encountered corner cases, such as depenedent types or linear types, and they\ntry to extend the type system. For example, if you are trying to figure out the type of \n[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)'s [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), you might realise that the type of the second\nargument depends on the type of the first argument.\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%f %s\", 1.2, \"hello\")\n```\nIf you want to encode this information into the type system, then you have just discovered\ndependent types, where types depend on values. The problem of finding out if a dependently\ntyped program is valid is actually undecidable (as a subset of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)). One you say you want this, you have stepped out\nof the safety of decidable typing and you might now need to prove to the compiler\nusing a formal proof that a program typchecks, such as in languages such as [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A good documentation of this problem is on the website [typing is hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html).\n\nIn my view, the ideal type system of a programming language should be decidable. I don't want\nto have to write a proof that my progam is valid. The best type system for this is [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) which is about as far as you can creep before you plumet off the cliff of undeciability.\n\n# Presbuger Arithmetic\n\nAnother beautiful example of walking the tightrope of decidability is [Presburger Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic). Surprisingly, it is a formulation of arithmetic\nwhere every statement is decidable by a simple algorithm. For example, you can say \n`x+y \u003e 10` and the Presburger algorithm will find all satisfying x and y. What is the catch?\nThere is no multiplication. Presbuger Arithmetic only has plus, equals, there exists, and for all.\nSo statements about prime factorization, for example, are impossible to state in Presburger Arithmetic. It seems that multiplcation is intricately linked with undecidability. And\nOnce we say we want multiplication, arithmetic no longer becomes decidable.\n\n# Undecidability is Interesting\n\nUnlike programmers, who would want decidabilty type systems, we mathematicians do **not**\nwant decidability in our systems. In truth, decidable systems are boring, and pose no\ninteresting mathematical questions. Due to the well-established relationship between\nexpressiveness and decidability, once we make a system expressive enough to pose\ninteresting questions, it becomes undecidable. Furthermore, in decidable systems,\ntruth is simply a matter of computation. If you want to check if a statement is \ntrue, just run a computer to check it. Mathematics in decidable systems loses\nall its beauty and elegance of unconventional proofs.  So maybe undeciability isn't so bad.\n\n# Walking off the Cliff\n\nWhat can you take away from this? Well let's say you're designing a programming tool like\na configuration language or a macro system. Users might demand more and more features, until,\nunwittingly, your simple little tool becomes undecidable. This happened to C++ templates,\nwhere now they are [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189172/c-templates-turing-complete) (or in other words undecidable). So my advice is to\nkeep in mind the original goal of your project and be aware of any features that\nmight cause you to wander from the island of safety that is decidability. \n\n\n","date":"April 7, 2022","tags":["automata"," decidability"," presbuger arithmetic"," type system"],"title":"The Decidability Tradeoff","slug":"decidability-tradeoff","description":"There is a fine line between power and decidability","image":"/images/automata.jpeg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"sandeep-interview"},"buildId":"WCR0ek_sB7dRwDTN_PWEK","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
