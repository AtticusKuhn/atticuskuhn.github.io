I was inspired by the word-guessing game [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
to make my own spin on this fun idea. I am very passionate about [history](https://atticuskuhn.github.io/blog/historical-music), so I decided to make a game where you guess a historical figure.

For each guess, you get to know the distance away they were born, how many years apart they were born
and some commonalities. For example, if the secret person was Napoleon and you guessed, historicle
would tell you they were born 9000 km apart, they were born 235 years apart, and both were commissioned
military officers.

I think my game is really fun, so if you have any feedback, please [contact me](/contact)
