My friend Jerry made this fun game called [make money](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-money/jilechdbojlnkjfimmbijgcfmblddejk?hl=en). It became really popular at school.
Later, he abandonded the project, and so I revamped it, by adding in more items, games, etc.
I consider make money 2 to be a substantial improvment
