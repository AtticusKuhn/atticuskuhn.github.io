Have you ever wanted to graph like [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
but with more simplicity? I have implemented a graphing calculator in only
136 lines of javascript. It uses [Webgl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)
in order to draw straight from your GPU, greatly increasing the
speed of the grapher.
