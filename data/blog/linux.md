# Linux

I recently began to experiment with trying Linux, a free and open source operating system. I am a supporter
of open-source software because I believe that it gives us true control over what we do on our electronic
devices. 

# Nixos

For my first foray into the wild world of Linux, I decided to try Nixos because I think the philosophy
of everything being in 1 config file is pretty interesting. 


# My Experience

For the first few days, I couldn't get the X11 server to start and I was stuck in the TTY. I eventually
figured out that it was an issue with Intel Graphics, so I fixed it.

My experience was a bit slow and clunky starting out, but eventually, I became faster after I'd learning
all the tricks of the new software. I actually think I am faster and more efficient now because open-source
software tends to follow the Unix Philosophy of being modular and also has lots of modes and keybindings
to speed things up. 

# Software I've used

The thing I like most about free software is that it seems such software gives ultimate control and
customizability to the user. Here are the software packages that I am using right now, which I believe
grant the user ultimate control

* Nixos
* Emacs
* Xmonad / Xmobar

I'm looking for a new terminal to use. Right now I'm using Xterm, which isn't very good. If you have any
recommendations of terminals that I should try, you can contact me.


# My Configuration

If you want to see what configuration and dotfiles I'm using, go to my github because I have posted
my dotfiles and configuration files there.
