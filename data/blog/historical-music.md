# Why Look at Historical Music?

In this blog post, I am going to analyze the music of several countries from history that I personally
find interesting. I have been interested in history for a long time, and if you are also interested
in history, then I think that music is uniquely positioned to gain an understanding of the past.
Humans have been creating music for [at least 3500 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tfBLvlN98),
and probably longer, so there seems to be something intrisic to humans about creating music.
Furthermore, since most songs are short (on the order of 5 minutes), we must distill our soul
and essence into a simple and memorable phrase in order to be musical. This desire creates brevity,
which can easily help us gain the gist of a historical society. This need is amplified
by folk music, which is designed to be easily sung by large groups of people, so is often
melodically and lyrically simple (simple does not necessarily mean bad). These are the
historical societies I will analyze through the lens of music


# Soviet Union / Russia
The first song we will look at is [Swallowing Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAoibAgAvM).
Below I have posted the lyrics:

| Russian      | English |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Да один, я остался один |yes, I was alone|
|а все друзья мои полегли,|and all my friends perished,|
|Вся надежда – один магазин|all hope is on one magazine|
|просто так не возьмёте, скоты!| But you won't take me that easy, brutes!|

We can see that the Russians fight till the end with resourcefullness ("But you won't take me that easy"). I think this is in keeping with Russian character. Looking at [Russian History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia), it is certainly brutal. This song portrays Russian
stoicism and bravery in the face of hardships, but another song shows the other face of
the coin. [Don't Tell Mom I'm In Chechnya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHCzaiJEoEY)
is a more depressing song about a soldier lamenting and cursing the horrors of the
Chechnyan War. 

| Russian      | English |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|С другом Саней что он вернется держу пари|I made a bet with my friend Sanya, that he will return|
|Ты только маме что я в Чечне не говори.|Just don't tell mom that I'm in Chechnya.|

The dark truth is that if the singer made a bet against Sanya that he will come back, that
implies that Sanya bet he would die. In the hard history of Russia, I imagine that a
bit of morbid humour would be necessary to survive and make sense of it. 


# Germany
The next culture we will look at the songs of is Germany. One especially moving song is
[Ich Hatt' Einen Kameraden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1Z1y2PSNw).

| German | English|
| ------ | -------|
|Er liegt vor meinen Füßen|Now he lies here at my feet|
|Als wär's ein Stück von mir|As if he were part of me|
|Will mir die Hand noch reichen,|Yet he reached out his hand to me,|
|Kann dir die Hand nicht geben|I cannot take your hand, right now|
|Bleib du im ew'gen Leben|May you rest there, in eternal life|
 
Prussia has sometimes been described as [not a country with an army, but an army with a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army#:~:text=The%20social%20classes%20were%20all,an%20army%20with%20a%20country%22.). This lead to many great military victories for Prussia, but
also immense loss for the soldiers on the battlefield. The line that particularly stands
out is "As if he were part of me", because it depicts the tight bond that forms between
soldiers on the battlfield. The singer and his comrade are so close that theey feel
physically attached.

On a more uplifiting note, the next song we will look at is [Palästinalied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UBQArOa5c), a song based on a poem from the 13th century.
|German|English|
|------|-------|
|Nû lebe ich mir alrêrst werde,| Now I live only worthy|
|sît mîn sündic ouge sihet| Since my sinful eye sees|
|daz hêre lant und ouch die erde,| The pure land and also the earth|
|der man vil der êren gihet.| which is worshipped so much|

You can almost hear the wonder coming from this song. I like to imagine a knight who has
heard so much about Jerusalem finally arriving and praising what he sees. Even though, this
song still remains a tone solumn and humble ("sinful eye sees"). It's almost like
the author is humbled by being in such a special place. 
 
 
# France
Now onto a nation bording Germany, which is France. I have recently taken a liking
to the song [Vive Henri IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MFBD15ehjA)

|French|English|
|------|-------|
|Au diable guerres,|To hell with wars,
|Rancunes et partis !|Grudges and partisanship!|
|Comme nos pères|Like our fathers|
|Chantons en vrais amis,|Let us sing as true friends,
|Au choc des verres,|Clink the glasses,|
|Les roses et les lys.|The roses and the lilies.|

Aside from having a really spritely melody, the lyrics also have a fun and playful nature.
It has a message of celebration, not only of the honourable monarch [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), but also of the festivites. I reccomend singing this song
at your next party.

We will next study [Seigneurs, Sachiez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSyaOE-O8s), which
was amazingly composed by King Theobald I. Can you imagine any current monarchs writing
such a good song? 

|French|English|
|------|-------|
|Tuit li mauvés demorront par deça| All the bad people will stay behind|
|qui n'aiment Dieu, bien, ne honor, ne pris.| those who don't love God, honor, or pray to Him|
|Et chascuns dit: "Ma feme, que fera?| And some say "what will my wife do?|
|Je ne lairoie a nul fuer mes amis!"| I will not leave without my friends"|
|Cil sont cheoit en trop fole atendance,|These men have fallen into foolish concerns|
|qu'il n'est amis fors de cil, sans doutance,| For man has no friends except|
|qui por nos fu en la vraie crois mis.| He who was put on the true cross for our sake|

I imagine that persuading people to go on the crusades must have been a hard task.
As a king, Theobold I probably had to convince thousands of people to go to a far
away and strange land. A song would be a very effective way to communicate his
message. In the song, he presents possible objections to going crusading ("what will my 
wife do?"), and then explains why these concerns are not valid. 

# Britain

# Yugoslavia
There is a very good video ["My Obsession With Wartime Yugoslav Music"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8EQllZFqLg) that also covers some of these same songs. I think the reason
why Yugoslav music is good good is because of the harsh tensions of the Yugoslav war,
where 5 societies that were essentially identical (their languages
are all mutually intelligible) had to justify why they were actually distinct.
They accomplished this through music. First, we will look at [My Dad is a War Criminal!
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwioIc6a_8).

|Serbian|English|
|Moj je tata zločinac iz rata|My dad is a war criminal 
|Vi se potrudite pa ga osudite|You can try condemning him|
|Nema niko muda da vodi ga do suda |But no one has the balls to arrest him |
