Complex analysis might just be my favorite field of mathematics. It is a field steeped in
elegance, and it makes it apparent that calculus was always supposed to be done on the complex numbers. 


You must be stupid to think that real analysis is better than complex
analysis. In real analysis, functions can be not differentiable, but in complex analysis,
if a function is once-differentiable, it is infinitely differentiable. Also, if you know
a complex function on an interval, you know it for all numbers.
